0,"I would like to give a shout out to sf fire credit union on a few notes. Im in the real estate industry so ive worked with a number of banks and credit unions. These guys are very easy to work with, get things done in a timely manor and if you call there is always someone available to pick up the phone and talk you through whatever it is you need. Very personal. I applied for a few equity lines of credit on some properties. I called them and told them I hated filling out applications and they said no problem and spent over an hr with me on the phone doing it for me .  I than  submitted all my documents and within 1 week they called me back and I was approved , done , ready to go, just like that. Superior service from most banks ive dealt with. My contact was Rashida Rencher  1-415-345-5421 rrencher@sffirecu.org. She was great to work with, very knowledgeable, fun, polite and professional and put up with all my questions. I will continue to do business all day with this CU for any of my lines of credit needs.",5

2,"They will charge you a $25 ""courtesy fee"" if you go over balance. Not just for the first time, but for EVERY time, no matter how small. If you are at zero balance, and buy a $10 drink, you'll pay $36 for it.It's legalized robbery that most banks don't do anymore. They're pretty smug about it too. I'll never do business with them again. Can't remember why I did in the first place. There are many banks to choose from.",1
3,"I changed to a credit union because I wanted to support local and stop supporting bad banks. They've finally sorted out the mobile banking app fiasco, but it's still raught with problems. Today I'm being asked to print, sign, and scan a form just to have blatantly obvious fraudulent activity reviewed. This is ridiculous. Imagine you are traveling and were a victim of fraud and needed the money to complete your trip. Do better SF Fire.",1
4,"I used to recommend SFFire to my friends (and got several to join), and I believe strongly in the value of Credit Unions.The changes that they've made over the past year, particularly to their online portal, have made it incredibly painful to do just about anything. Most of the old features are missing, giving you no other option than to go their physical bank or (shudder) make a phone call.I am not convinced that their new leadership has the same strong customer service priorities that SF Fire has historically had.",2
5,"I have been with the credit union for over 25 years.  Unfortunately, in recent years (2+) the personalized service, familiar faces, and standard of excellence has changed....down, down, down.The initial concept of shared banking was a wonderful addition.  There is really no more shared banking at SFFCU, only ATM service.  No longer working or living in the city, extremely limited ""shared banking"", hours on hold, on-going change in personnel, makes it beyond frustrating in making it my bank.  I come from a family of firefighters, and the credit union no longer favors the fire fighters, their families, and personalized service.  So disappointing.",2
6,"I have been banking with SFFCU 20+ years and in the past couple years the service has completely fallen off.  Their ""new"" website is worse than the old site (not sure how they managed to do that), they completely botched the transfer over to the new site, they did not remove people i requested to no longer have access to my account (took 2 additional calls), they never responded to my request to get a car loan with them, and today I logged-in and attempted to use the online chat to get a quick answer to a simple question only to wait 1hr and get my session auto ended with ZERO RESPONSE FROM SFFCU!! Their website when logged-in as a banker doesn't even note the phone number to contact the bank (I had to log out and look at their nonmember page).I really don't know what is going on with this bank.  Everything going on with this bank tells me it is time to move my money somewhere else.",1
7,"Used to be really, really good! Now the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing and when it finds out it made an error, it doesn't care!!!One mistake made by a teller at the branch accumulated into two and a half years of explaining and re-explaining because of employee after employee leaving. The remedy was not completed on their side and again, no follow up.",1
8,"RED FLAGIf you use more than half your credit, they will close off your credit with little warning.",1
9,"What follows is the verbatim feedback I sent to the management at SF Fire Credit Union.  I feel it will suffice for my review. § When I joined SFFCU it was amazing and provided for my needs, however, it has been some time now that SF Fire Credit Union has gone downhill and continues this downward slide.  This slide is causing not only me but other members (See Yelp Reviews) to contemplate and look for other Credit Unions that meet our needs.  The 1-star ratings far outweigh the higher ratings with most indicating the new CEO as the cause of these issues.I too will be adding my review to Yelp and sadly it will be a 1-star rating.The ""New Online Banking"" is the worst, asking for answers to security questions that were never asked nor responded too.  Asking for a username when in reality it wants my member number.  Then indicating a wrong password has been input when the correct password was input.The ATM machine at the Main Branch (3201 California Street) for the second week in a row does not work, this is inexcusable.  It is tremendously slow, old and outdated.The Mobile Banking app is a sorry excuse for an app.  This is reflected by it 1.8 customer rating. Depositing a check with this worthless app is maddening and after the 3rd attempt, I uninstalled the app.The one time I tried the live chat and got a message that I was being directed outside of SF Fire Credit Union to a ""Trusted Partner"" (see image) which prompted an immediate disconnect.  With identity theft on the rise, why on earth would I give my banking information to anyone outside of SFFCU trusted or not.  This is totally absurd. The Contact Center should be and needs to be open 24/7/365. Often time things happen that need immediate attention and the Contact Center is conveniently CLOSED!All of these issues can be overcome, but how many members does SFFCU need to lose before it recognizes these problems and corrects them?",1
10,"BEWARE!! BEWARE!! I am looking into suing this bank. They have frozen my money on multiple occasions now. Showing my account balance as the correct number but suddenly ""available funds"" are zero. Most recently they charged me a bunch of random fees that I have to dispute. These actions cause checks to bounce and auto payments to fail. I'm on the phone constantly, simply trying to do damage control from being associated with this bank. Feels like they are trying to avoid a run on the bank. They are clearly on their last leg. Seriously, avoid this place at all cost.",1
11,"I used to love SF Fire Credit Union.  I talked about how great it was to friends and coworkers because it really did used to be great.In fall of 2017 SF Fire Credit Union did an overhaul of its app, site and customer service - the result was awful.  It's impossible to just update a payee anymore, when I updated my mortgage payee information I see the correct info online but the backend somehow was not updated and SF Fire Credit Union lost my March mortgage payment.  It's been weeks of calling constantly and trying to get anyone to be a customer advocate.  I am currently looking for a new credit union as I have zero faith in this one any more.",1
12,"AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!  After 15 years of OK service - just OK, never great because their online banking was problematic, what did they do?  Totally scrap their online banking and installed a new system.  Great idea! HORRIBLE EXECUTION!  Their new online banking system is impossible - the worst design ever.  I've spent 9 months (!) trying to get answers and solutions to all the new problems their dysfunctional system created.  To top it off, their help system, which used to be pretty good, has gotten worse, so recent ""helps"" and ""assistance"" I've gotten has compounded issues by creating new problems.  Max Edwards, who became my ""go-to"" guy to solve my problems once I threatened to move all my $ to another bank, stopped returning my emails and phone calls after a few months.  How the CEO was never fired for going with this horrible new online system I'll never know.",1
13,"Like many others here, in the space of just one year I have gone from loving the SF Fire Credit Union to finding it so broken and unprofessional that I can't trust them with my money any longer.Problems with new technology are to be expected; it's how you react to them that really makes the difference. SFFCU has been abysmal in this regard.The new bill pay system is a disaster. I had a rent check go unsent but their website & the app both showed it had been sent successfully! Naturally I didn't find out until the mgmt co called me asking after their money, which conveniently happened while I was traveling abroad. The SFFCU never could explain the problem, but in the end tried to blame me, saying ""you must have changed something within 24 hours of the scheduled payment."" 1) Their system said the payment was successful. 2) I didn't change anything, 3) if I had they presumably should know *what* (vs. ""something"") I'd changed, 4) the web app should not allow breaking changes without telling the user, and 5) did I mention I didn't change anything? As of today, their website shows the payment as failed, the mobile app still says it was successful.I had one customer support rep (local, but with grade school English) insult me for calling twice to follow up on this problem after they'd promised to follow up with me about by a specific date, but had not. Not only do they not care what went wrong, their customers are pests if they care.It is astounding that a beloved and reliable institution could fall apart so quickly, but that is what's happened. I hope they can bring it back, but I can't bet my farm on it.",1
14,"I believe there's an orchestrated effort by the credit union leadership to lose as many clients as possible in the shortest time possible. This is the only explanation as to why the level of service has been degraded so much. Perhaps they bit more than they can chew...I didn't change my opinion about SF Fire Credit Union overnight. No, it took three formidable strikes.Strike 1.I lost my wallet while vacationing in EU last summer. I immediately called SFF CU to cancel the debit card and I asked the representative to send the replacement card the fastest way possible to my home address (since they wouldn't ship it anywhere else). It took three weeks for the card to arrive at my home address. Meanwhile, I was stranded on an island in Croatia, and if it wasn't for the cash my travel friends gave me, it wouldn't have been a rough ordeal.Strike 2.I send money to family and friends located in EU every so often. SFF CU used to charge $25 for ACH transactions. Well, that has changed. Most recently when I tried to send money I learned that the fee has increased to $60. Fine, I said, let's just complete the transaction. The wire transfer ""goes through"" and I am charged $80. Not happy about this but at least the money will be delivered. Well, not really. After seven days of waiting and checking in to make sure the money is delivered, I learn that because the way SFF CU has executed the transaction the local bank is requiring a proof of money's origin. Long story short, the money was returned to my account and that took 5 additional days. I was charged an additional $30 for the pleasure. To recap, I've spent $110 to have the money take a trip to EU and back. Strike 3.I have a consumer line of credit with $0 balance that I have not used in years. I've misplaced the credit card long time ago and I paid a visit to their California branch to get a replacement card (because that's a more convenient way of doing business with this institution instead of being on the phone for hours). I've asked the person over the counter to cancel the old card and send me a new one in the mail. She said the new card will arrive within 5 business days. It's been a month since then. I don't actually need the credit card, I just need a bank I can rely on.",1
15,"Super wonderful bank! I left Well Fargo a few years ago and the difference is amazing. Hardly any issues, and if there have been any they were fixed asap! I had a card issue today and a teller at this branch (I believe her name was Moné) was super patient and helped me out very quickly and was incredibly friendly. I haven't regretted banking with them once. Plus the main branch is super nice, clean, welcoming, and they always have candy bowls...",5
16,"I've been a longtime member but am fed up. I'm closing my accounts. I always loved this credit union and recommended it to others. The best thing about it was their customer service. I could always get someone on the phone within 2 minutes and they were helpful and service-oriented. ATM visits were free, and there were multiple ways to deposit checks: mail or phone. Whatever way you used, the funds were available immediately. The online system was old, but totally worked. All that has changed in the last year. Now you can only deposit checks by phone; if they can't read the photo of your check, you're out of luck. Worse, the funds are no longer available immediately. The entire online system was redesigned and it's been impossible to access since. I had to set up all my accounts again, my husband was locked out of our joint account for months, and our recurring transfers from other banks were all cancelled. This all resulted in some very challenging bill-paying for a couple months, and two returned checks. The worst part is that the customer service, which used to be incredible, has gone down the tubes. Now no matter what time of day you call you have to wait for 15-20 minutes because ""we are experiencing high call volumes."" Messages sent to their online help center are never acknowledged or replied to. And the agents are no longer service-oriented. I just called to alert them to the fact that they'd charged me an overdraft fee twice for the same returned check and the agent told me smugly: ""that's part of banking."" She offered to refund it as a ""one time courtesy, but know that if this ever happens again we will not be refunding it.""I've been a customer for the better part of a decade and usually keep my accounts in 4 digits. The only reason I had a returned check was because a) deposits are no longer available immediately and b) I can no longer link my accounts or do automatic transfers. So my math was off by a few dollars on paying my PG&E bill this month, and my bank charged me *twice* for the overdraft fee. And next time that happens, I'll be out of luck? Yeah, there won't be a next time. Bye.",1
17,"I'm really happy to be able to come back to this review and say that SFFCU has mostly returned to the quality service I have come to expect from them as a long-time customer. Although the online banking transition caused me numerous problems, including money disappearing from my account for a week, the new system has been working well since the difficult rollout concluded.I still agree with many of the reviewers who have commented that the credit union feels overall much more impersonal than it once did. SFFCU used to consistently exceed my expectations, and now I would say they just generally meet them.",4
18,"I used to love them but I am adding to the list in my dismay about SF Fire Credit Union. You have been warned. Do not use them. It has been nothing but a pain since they have changed their system.I am in tech, and the tech company that they worked with to change all of this should be outed and avoided by all. I am trying to navigate their system right now and I just have given up. I will have to call them or chat with them in order to figure something out that should be obvious.",1
19,1) Their new online banking they pushed on us is absolute shite2) I'm trying to buy crypto from my personal funds from my DEBIT card according to recent regulation is not buying on credit and keeps getting declined.SFFCU was great 5 years ago when I started with them. Now it's meh.,1
20,"I am writing this as I have been on hold now for 27 minutes, even though the recording states there are only 7 people in front of me.  I joined the SFFCU in 2003 and they were stellar.  Just fabulous!  Since the new CEO came in it's been a horrible nightmare, not to mention this new online service and lack of customer service over the phone.  I have been trying to speak to a live person for over 2 weeks now.  I've opted for 6 call backs and never received any.  It is so heartbreaking what has happened to this once fine credit union.  Poor structure. Poor organization. No customer service.  The customer service was once so professional and well, Live.  I live in the east bay and will now have to drive to San Francisco to get my banking done.As soon as my business is completed, I will be closing all of my accounts and moving to a new bank.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do NOT bank at SFFCU.  Do not join this business. Do yourself a favor and join another credit union.  It's not worth the headache. This experience will leave you in tears.  I guarantee.FIRE THE NEW CEO!!! Diane Dykstra and Darren were so much better!",1
21,"A business has to manage it's operation within conditions that don't leave it susceptible to liability. I understand that. However when I applied to refinance my car with them, they would have saved me so much time by telling me they don't loan out money for anything related to business use. For example Uber, handyman services, personal delivery. At the very least providing me with other options. Not the case with SFFCU.",3
22,"Outstanding employees! Helpful, knowledgeable. Great financial services. We're so glad to be members",5
23,"Before diving into this review, I want to call out the Customer Service reps at SFFIRE for being consistently amazing. Without fail, when I speak to a rep about my frustrations I leave the interaction feeling better about things. If the rest of the business operated at that same high level of respect for the customer, I wouldn't be closing my account after 10+ years. I have been a _very_ vocal supporter of SFFIRE over the years I have been a member. Although they haven't been the fastest adopters of new technology, they have been trustworthy and intuitive with their banking products. I could always rely on transfers to go through, checks to be paid and to have access to my information. Over the years, I've run into a few banking emergencies (Identity theft, lost cards, etc) and SFFIRE has gone out of their way to make it right. It used to feel like working with a small, neighborhood bank where people saw you as a person - not just as a line item on a membership spreadsheet. With the recent updates, this all changed. Recently, the Credit Union decided to make a change to their online banking system - without adequate testing or notifications to members. As I'm sure other reviews will show, this has been incredibly disruptive to members. In the past 30 days, I have had..* Online Bill Pay be reset, losing scheduled payments* Connections to services like Quicken be broken, with NO eta for resolution. Seriously, I spoke with a rep today who confirmed it's just broken with no timeline on getting fixed. * My Debit Card cancelled without notification* 2+ Weeks waiting for a new debit card after paying $15 to have it expedited* Multiple hour wait times on my calls / chats on these issues. I've had to make 5 calls in the past two weeks on the above issues.I am a huge fan of Credit Unions and after all the great people I've worked with at SFFIRE, it truly bums me out to be leaving. I hope leadership learns a serious lesson from this debacle and starts putting it's members first again. It's a Credit Union, for goodness sake. Start acting like it, again.",2
24,"I used to recommend SFFCU to anyone who asked for bank recommendations in the area, but now I can't wait until my accounts are finally closed and I'm done dealing with SFFCU. It took 3 weeks for me to get a response about the necessary steps to close my accounts, and when I finally did get an answer, they told me they STILL CAN'T SEND EXTERNAL TRANSFERS... even to my own accounts at my new bank. I have to walk in to the branch, withdraw all of my money, and physically carry it across the city. SFFCU - what happened? How did you drop the ball so badly, and how are you still not recovered from it? You have ONE JOB... when are you going to start doing it again?",1
25,"Things were run better with Darren Herrmann was their CEO. The new people running the credit  union aren't rude to you, they just don't care.  My current car was financed at SFFCU from 2012 to the present. I had an excellent payment history and paid the loan off 4 months EARLY. I applied for a new loan and was rejected. When I spoke with their loan officer she references a ten year old debt on my credit report and tells me, ""I dont know why you were even approved for the car you have now."" She then tells me that she needs to speak with someone to see why they gave me the loan that I just paid off.  This is was two weeks ago. The online loan portal still says, ""Your loan application is currently under review."" (for 2 weeks??)Seems to me that SFFCU has already decided that they do not want my **return business** and the indifference of their loan officers speaks volumes about the declining customer service of this bank. Please send me the title to my car and I will be on my way to another bank who values their customers.",1
26,"If you depend on Quicken, please run for the hills and don't bank with these folks. If you need to download transactions, or keep books, you have to re do everything by hand.I banked with them and adored them for years. But their clunky 90s era website always was awful. But they recently updated it. It looks better, but all download functions were LOST and it's a useless website. It has thrown my business and rental income properties into total chaos.I loved this bank. But I'm done. Also: Their loan rates are quite a bit higher than any other bank out there. Always. It defeats the whole purpose of banking at a credit union, which used to be getting personal service, like human being who looks at you holistically and not just the FICO score. To get a fair deal on a mortgage, or a car loan, right? Well, wrong. At least here. As it is, you'll pay through the nose. And the fees? Forgetaboutit. Outrageous. Every time in the last seven years I refinanced or borrow money, their rates were so much higher than Bank of the West, Redwood Savings, or even Chase for heaven's sake. I just have given up.So sad, because other than that, they were a nice place to bank. If only they had actually affordable and useable banking services.",1
27,"Been a member of this credit union ever since I became a fireman 12 years ago, and it used to be fantastic. Customer service was incredible, and Darren Hermann did an outstanding job. Leadership is from the top down, and with the absolute fiasco that SFFCU is currently, it's clear that they have zero leadership. Customer service as poor as they offer today would never have been tolerated before. You will wait forever to speak to someone, who will usually be more interested in explaining why they can't access the system, than to be of any help. We will be looking for a new credit union immediately, one that acts like a damn ""CREDIT UNION"". I truly hope that SFFCU goes out of business, they absolutely deserve it at this point.  Shame on you SFFCU.",1
28,"In protest of their new app v3.0 I have the following to share :As a member for seven years, This new app is AWFUL. The interface is clunky and feels like something created in 1995. The entire design is like there was no thought put into it. As though sffire saw another app they liked and forced it on themselves. Unintuitive and bleak to the eyes. Buggy everywhere. I got kicked off of customer service chat with no warning and the chat window kept closing my keyboard and I couldn't see what I was writing or where I was in the conversation. As one of the first banking establishments to have an app, you've really gone so far backwards that its embarrassing. Please bring back the old app.",1
29,"""There are 246 callers ahead of you."" They could have avoided this disaster by communicating more clearly and personally with customers regarding the imminent transition. Instead, they beat us over the heads with generic messages like ""Transfer to new online system,"" without spelling out in detail exactly how this would affect us, waiting for us to suddenly get hit with unpleasant surprises on the day of. Like: I can no longer make payments via ACH transfers to vendors. I assume this also means if someone tries to pay me through ACH, I will never receive it. I don't actually know because my estimated wait time is greater than 30 minutes because there are 245 callers ahead of me. I asked to hold my place in line to request a call back. When I was in a meeting when they called me back at the end of the day, guess what, I lost my place in line. Now I get to do it all. Over. Again.",1
30,This place is a joke waited half an hour with the place is empty and not one person could help me despite me asking to speak with someone. Never coming here again. Non existent customer service.,1
31,"Been a customer since 2010 and I've never looked back. Banks should be accountable to their customers not their shareholders, and this bank caters to its clients. Whatever rumors you have heard about credit unions, SF Fire Credit Union will put them to shame. And don't worry, you will never have to file a class action lawsuit against them.",5
32,"Despite the huge growth in membership and occasional long waits on hold, I give SF Fire the highest grade possible of any financial institution I have dealt with, and I have dealt with many.  My faith in SF Fire was renewed with an excellent experience with an outgoing international wire, handled smoothly and professionally because of a transparent online submission system, and Robert in the wire transfer dept.  Also, their fees are still the best of any credit union, including no foreign exchange fees when using an overseas ATM.  I will be taking my membership with me and using my account even if I move overseas.",5
33,"I have been a customer for many years, and I'm seriously considering finding another credit union. Since they revamped their website, I have experienced nothing but problems. I needed a tutorial to learn how to transfer funds! It's a banking tool...how difficult could it possibly be? I had a 5-year loan payment which was paid automatically out of my account for 4 years and 5 months until they changed their site, and then the payments stopped for some reason. I had to call and get them to reinstate after sitting on hold for almost an hour. What a clusterf*ck.I'm not sure what happened, but what was once a fantastic place to bank has gone into the toilet. Both of their online and mobile sites/apps have been down since this AM and aren't expected to be back up until later this evening, according to a rep I spoke to. I have given feedback every time I have called and it doesn't seem that anyone is listening. The expression ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" seems very fitting here...maybe they should take some advice and leave well enough alone.",1
34,Business Members! If you are having trouble getting a hold of someone real - demand the call center to give you a phone number for the business services department. They finally did and I spoke to someone in their SF office and got what I needed immediatly.Behind all the mess the core of SF Fire still stands. And they are working hard to fix the issues.,5
35,"Like almost EVERYONE below me, absolutely LOVED the CU under the leadership of previous CEO. I single-handily referred like 10 customers to them. Then, a new CEO, new online banking system and it's prob the MOST poorly run banking operation I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing (and that includes Skank of Amerika, Hells Cargo, and Shitty Bank).I plan on going to the Annual member meeting only because it's going to be amazing to hear how they try and explain away gross negligence, mismanagement and the almost complete disintegration of member trust. Sad day but it's time to move on. This is not the credit union I once knew. #fireKathyElser",1
36,"I have loved SF Fire for years and use it both for my personal and business banking. HOWEVER, they've recently transferred over to a new banking system and I am no longer a fan. So many things have gone wrong I have been on the phone with them no less than 15 times. Today was absolutely the worst. I realized that somehow their online banking system sent double rent payments to my landlord. It did this last month as well and I spent an hour with customer service trying to remedy the problem. When it happened again this month I was livid. I hopped on what used to be a convenient and effective chat system and waited FOURTY minutes for a customer service representative to tell me, ""Oh yeah, looks like there's was a transfer in our old system that was set up but it was deleted. Anything else I can help you with?"" Yes, yes, there is something else you can help me with. You can tell me why the double transfer happened again this month if it was deleted. You can tell me why your new system makes it impossible to see the reoccurring transfers that I set up in your old system. You can tell me why it took forty minutes for you to tell me you see the double transfer. I decided to get off of chat and call customer service. After waiting AGAIN I'm told I need to call a different number. It's now been over an hour I've been trying to deal with the bank. I call the new number and it says there are TWENTY SEVEN people in front of me. I waited twenty minutes and hung up. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. This is people's money. Get your act together SF FIRE.",1
37,"All I need to say is run. Run far far away from this bank. It's been such a disaster lately - I want to pull my hair out every time with the app. And calling to ask for help once your locked out of the app for literally ZERO reason, the person does not help you AT ALL!!! It's been a nightmare and I am very very very frustrated by it all. My ex and I both have accounts here and all my brothers and sisters - so we transfer money back and forth or I'd have kicked rocks a long Long time ago. But my direct deposit i am taking away and finding a new place to bank. It's honestly super sad as my Da opened up my account with them when I was born and I've been a member for 30 years :( Just wish they'd go back to the 5 star bank they once were.",1
38,"I've been with them since 2012 and they were great.... until they started making subtle changes like reducing the number of refundable ATM fees and changing their hours, but the straw that broke the camel's back was the sudden upgrade to a whole new online and mobile banking system. Everything worked as it should on the old system- you can activate your cards, report your cards stolen, report travel notifications, etc. Well, say goodbye to all of that. Not only are those functions no longer available online, mobile depositing was down for a good month, my 'automatic' car payments were constantly withdrawing the wrong amounts, and it took forever to reach anyone using their 'chat' feature which in the past took no more than a couple minutes. Yes, they do have competitive auto loan rates and still refund on ATM fees, albeit a small finite amount, but I don't think it outweighs the inconvenience of using their 'new' system. I used to constantly rave about this credit union, but I think it might be time for me to look elsewhere. I suggest avoiding at all cost if you are looking for a user friendly and comprehensive system to do your banking.",1
39,"I wanted to open a checking account with them b/c BofA which I was with for 26 years  changed their free checking requirements to high balance minimum I walked into to the branch no one was in front but 2 ipads.

Don't think so just turned around walked right out. I aint ever coming back.BYE FELICIA!!!!",1
40,"Updated: 2/18/18  I have since closed account and am very happy at new financial institution.I had a friend who was going to open an account here based on my praises before the conversion fiasco!  That person was just a couple of days away from joining. After my updated info that person won't go near this credit union.Original 2/2/18While there are so many advantages to belonging to a credit union, this is not a Credit Union I can recommend.Customer Service has gone from A+ to C-The implementation of the new online banking system was totally mismanaged.  FThe new online banking system  FIt is cumbersome not user friendly and it seems that it is not going to get any better. I am not confident about the security of the system.The ATMs are old and cumbersome.  D  If they ""upgarade"" that system I hope they will do it much better than the implementation of new on line system.It seems the common thread for most of this - excluding ATMs - is the fairly new President and CEO Kathy Elser.  My grade for her is D-.I am switching back to a major bank which based on my experience has stellar customer service.",1
41,"Somehow this feels like the new wave of everything. This is how it works now:  Take something wonderful that works perfectly well for the member clients (who are so thrilled with the credit union offerings and service, they feel like they're in on something special!), then decide arbitrarily to make a change to the system that completely doesn't work (with very vague and uninformative explanations for why this change was essential, other than a vague reference to ""security"").  When I've called, and had to wait then leave the call in frustration, and finally succumbed to leaving a ""voice of the member"" message that went unanswered, I'm left wondering, who was the one who decided this is a good idea?  Was this just another bad idea sold to us as an ""improvement"" we needed?The changes are ill-timed (end-of-the year, holidays, not to mention what's happening around us in the world) and the new website was not only so poorly introduced, it has taken away most of the useful functions that many loved (like being able to write descriptions for each transaction, make ACH transfer payments and keeping a clear track of payment and transaction history!).  Payments I thought were made were lost.  They've offered to pay the penalties.  But what about the time it's taken to figure out the state of things?  All the calls to vendors and services wondering whether they got paid!  How is it possible that ALL the history of past payments were wiped out, and when I asked about it, I was told to do a search in my account for past payments!! Is this a joke?  It's like we went from 2005 back to 1996, and were told ""Get with the program, this is better for you!  Are you a Luddite?""  B-S-.  Clearly the care SFFCU has always exhibited has left the building.  The mea culpa message written by the CEO was a joke and insulting.  The usual ""we're working to fix the problem"" left so much unanswered:  When?  How?  The only real fix is to abandon this project billed as an improvement (Millennium Tower, anyone?  How about that stadium in Santa Clara?) and go back.Like everyone else who's left a review, I am heartbroken.  I was a disciple of SFFCU, having switched from a big bank in 2011 and after a short time, and such great products and services, convinced more than a few of my friends and family members to make the switch to SFFCU.  Leave the Corporate Bank!   I did, finally after being with WF for over 27 years, and reluctantly leaving at first, but so glad I did.  Here I am, just 6 years later, and facing the fact that I have to leave another financial institution yet again.When I finally did get a chance to speak to someone, it was suggested that I'd feel differently once I learned the new system.  Sure, just like I now enjoy paying $35 for checking a bag on an airplane and not getting a meal of any kind on a cross-country flight. I'm left now, at the holidays and end of the year, like thousands of others, with a system I don't trust and a need to leave this credit union.  I asked if there was a way to go back to the old system, and again, I got treated like I was just another person who couldn't adapt to new technology.  Again, BS.I live in the present, accept change, (mostly) enjoy new technology.  But I can't accept technological changes that strip away the benefits and ease for a system that offers no benefit but frustration. I'm not going back.I'd love to hear from anyone from SFFCU who has a suggestion for a new credit union/financial institution.  I'd prefer not to go back to the big bank, but if I have to I will.Thank you for the good years, SFFCU.",1
42,"Originally left a big bank for the improved customer service and lower rates of a credit union. It's been good up until the implementation of their new banking system this month...When attempting to log into their new system with my account number, it was linked to a completely different person - the security questions and phone number associated with my account number were completely different. Yes, I made sure it was my account number and not a typo. This kind of error should never happen, and it goes shows complete incompetency on their end to release a website to members with a bug as critical as I described. So after waiting over 90 minutes to speak with a customer support agent, they said that I'll need to reregister my information to relink my account... Guess what? The registration on their site is currently disabled. The agent mentioned that my error was not a one-off and members have been calling in and complaining about the same issue.So, in summary, my account number is currently linked to someone else's record and I have no way of retrieving it/correcting their mistake unless I visit a branch.",1
43,"Adding yet another one star review for the abysmal state of things over the last few weeks since the online/mobile ""updates"" (more like regression...)  I used to love this bank, it was easy to use and customer service always picked up right away.  Now there is an unending wait on hold for a rep who sounds like they are just making up answers to appease disgruntled customers.  And the bank has not issued any updates to the members about problems with the roll-out or any apologies.  I'm currently searching for a new bank and will be relieved to remove my money from such a sinking ship!",1
44,"Used to be excellent, a jewel in the rough. New CEO came in and it's been all downhill since then. For some unknown reason they decided to upgrade the online banking system, and it's a disaster. It's way less user friendly. Furthermore key functions are lost, it's no longer possible to send ACH transfers to other people. Even transfers within the credit union are gone. The phone lines, where you used to be answered by a person almost immediately are permanently jammed with an automated system and ages to get someone. All the reasons to be here are slipping away.",1
45,"I'm adding to the chorus of ""it used to be great in so many ways... and now it's impossibly difficult and horrible."" Not only is customer service in shambles, but I have financed and paid off two cars with this institution (I am one of its first members), and I have most recently been unable to get them to finance my newest car (so I went to Alliance Credit Union in San Jose and was approved with an even better interest rate). What happened? My credit is A. I've paid off two with you. I've increased my income... I used to refer and recommend SFFCU to everyone. I was simply so happy to have a banking institution that made me feel as if they valued my business and my financial safety. Not anymore. The new online banking website acts and looks pre-Y2K. DEAR BOARD MEMBERS: Can you do something? This is severely unfortunate.",1
46,"How can there be 0 people ahead of me in line, and yet I've still been waiting on hold for 20 minutes? This service is insulting. On past occasions people in the call center have discussed my account with me and failed to verify my identity properly, just asked for my member number. That is shocking from a financial institution. I emailed the manager about it, no response. I have a credit card at Chase and I'm considering moving my banking there as well. The customer service is professional and courteous, nothing like SF Fire.",1
47,"When you call, you are on hold for 25 minutes, then a agent comes on the phone to put you on hold again for another 10 minutes. Won't be using this Credit Union to open up an account. Suggestion: Hire more staff to handle incoming calls. If there were no stars to give I would give a ZERO star.",1
48,I used to love SF fire credit union. It is now a nightmare. Have no clue what they were thinking or who was in charge of this new on line banking. They make it impossible to pay loans or even log in. I regret getting my vehicle loan with them. In the past they were amazing. Don't get me wrong. The employees here are so nice and are more than willing to help. But it is out of their hands. They are now overwhelmed with calls that have their costumers on hold over 30min. Now my car payment is late and I feel obligated to drive out there instead of calling. It's probably faster from the east bay. Consider using a different credit union if you can.,1
49,"I really wonder if this ...is....the beginning of the End of SF Fire Credit Union...  Within the last 6 months there have been a half a dozen issues affecting my banking relationship that can only be defined by Administrative Incompetence..... This appears ...premeditated!    The latest is today..... Am told by representative via phone moments ago, that online banking system is down.....and has been unavailable for atleast 25% of total members for almost 6 hours...    I am about to start looking to move to another financial institution, because it just feels like NOONE IS IN CHARGE...  sorry..  i have been a member  for almost nine years..(UPDATE-twitter... system will not be up until tomorrow morning   3/30/18 by start of business... for many people including myself...keep you posted-lol )",1
50,My FAV Credit Union Location: I  love this location for myriad reasons:1. Smart staff - results oriented and gracious2. Short lines...if at all.3. Great location - Laurel Village/Presdio Heights4. Free parking (in San Francisco!)5. Bowls oxo Sweet TreatsI've been trading here for over eight years...no complaints.,5
51,I have been using the credit union for over 5 years and I'm not sure what happened but their services have gone completely down hill.They use to be so helpful and so convenient. I would rave about their services to friends and family. I used to do everything on the mobile app and when I would call in they were more than happy to transfer money between accounts even if I had reached my limit. Now it's the total opposite. Everyone there is a robot and when you are having an issue they just repeat the same thing over and over again. I was very frustrated and they just kept interrupting me over the phone. I finally had to hang up because they weren't hearing me at all and were extremely condescending. I have to go into banks now to make deposits or even transfer money when I used to be able to do this all online.Sad to see a good bank go bad.,1
52,"Excellent service here. I've been coming here for a while now and can vouch for their service. They do inter-Credit Union banking flawlessly, the people are competent and courteous, they have Halloween bite sized chocolates at the counter 365 days a year, and a clean facility overall. Credit Unions unite!",5
53,"I've been a member of the SF fire credit union for 19-20 years! When firemen used to work in the bank and processed loans.  If they knew you, you got the money no questions asked for a loan.  They took care of you and sorted any problems on the spot. The good ol' days.Fast forward to new (all civilian) management and this god forsaken crap website and mobile app.  Sure, all things must change.  Businesses must keep up with current technology.    Unfortunately the credit union made some wrong turns and poor management decisions as you can see by all the negative reviews.  Whoever designed the new website and app must, must! be coerced into looking for a different line of work.  It's an embarrassment to the bay area and the center of high tech.  My (tech field) spouse even commented on the rudimentary site.In my case, accounts that I transfer to have all been deleted.  People I owe money to have been patiently waiting for me to either set their transfer to accounts back up by calling each one to get their bank info or me closing this account and moving to another credit union.  The latter is most likely going to happen.Customer service is the sh*ts.  I was told I will be called right back.  30 mins later still sitting here waiting for a call is confirming the move to another bank is imminent. (Update: I never got a call back that day)I have 2 accounts to keep track of.  The layout of the new website is a mess.  It won't separate SFFCU members and external bank account members from their specific accounts.  They just get pooled together when I'm trying to transfer money.  So even if I wanted to transfer monies TO an outside account I have to scroll through a ton of accounts to find the correct one that correlates with the right FROM account.Depositing a mobile app check is sometimes futile.  Now I just learned that I no longer have the ability to transfer money to someone that has an external bank account.  I have to set up Bill Pay to do that THEN the credit union sends them a physical check which takes about 1 week!!!  HAHHA! For those born yesterday, a check is a piece of paper you would once trade goods for.  You would have to fill in the name of the receiver and write out, with an actual ink pen, the amount you are paying for.  Yes, the SF Fire credit union just set themselves back about 30 years.I'm done.  It was a good run.  Please change the name of the Fire credit union as to not be an embarrassment to the first responders of the City.",2
54,"I've been a member for about 5 years.I've never had an issue with the bank until maybe a few months ago when I called to get information about personal loans. The gentlemen I spoke to practically laughed in my face when I said I was 22 years old. Strike one.I called again because I got locked out of my account and needed to transfer money from accounts asap.  The woman who I was speaking to kept putting me on hold, before i even told her what I was calling about. When I finally got her back on the line, I began explaining I got locked out of my account and needed the money transferred asap because my car payment would be withdrawn the following day. She said she did it, but she didn't. My account overdraft and I was hit with an additional 25$ fee. I asked them to reverse it, they did but they said for me to opt out of courtesy pay.Why would I opt out if the problem was cause because YOUR employee said they would make the transfer and never did.Strike two.Today I called the call center and the gentlemen I spoke to was helping me opt out of courtesy pay, but the option wasn't showing up on my end and he then said ""if its too complicated for you.."". I kept telling myself, just get this over with.As the call went on, the option to opt out still wasn't there. I began getting frustrated because by this time, we were on the phone for 20 minutes and still, nothing was being done. I was having the same issue and he was getting more and more condesending. I asked to speak to a superior, and instead of letting me speak to them directly he just played messenger.Strike threeI finally got the supervisor on the phone and she was a joke too. Ha ha haIf you ever want to be belittled, call the call center (:If you have any problems or questions, do yourself a favor and go to the Stonetown location.",1
55,"Amazing service.  Let me give just one example: I had a credit card with SF Fire CU that was about to expire.  I called a couple of weeks ago to inquire about the replacement card, and was told that it would arrive in two weeks.  Well two weeks later it hadn't arrived.  So I wrote a message to the executive management team (right from the front page of the website, you can always send a note to the CEO and management), asking if they could expedite, especially since I was leaving the next day on belated honeymoon.  I got a response from them within _minutes_, letting me know they could have a replacement card ready for me to pick up that afternoon at one of their branches, or they could send me the replacement card overnight to wherever I was staying.  After arranging to pick up the card at the Mint Plaza branch in the Financial district at 5 PM that same day (merely four hours since I had contacted them), they even offered to buy me a drink at the bar next door while I waited.  Now that friends, is first class service.",5
56,I love SFFCU! Especially no fee international currency exchange through ATM/withdrawals. That meant a $17 rebate for using the ATM at the airport in Mexico! The online app is easy to navigate and super convenient for transfers and depositing my paychecks. Writing this review has me craving one of their funsize snickers...,5
57,"Convenient, nearly everything free, outstanding customer service. What more could you ask for?",5
58,"signed up, was good, free checks, atm refunds. six years later rewards vanished, new website dumpster fire, horrible call center, rats fleeing sinking ship, etcThat sums it up, I think.",1
59,"Tuesday, 2:30 PM.This review is for their online Checking option. Quickie:- Weak user interface for digital services- Frequent freezes when reviewing transaction history- Limited options for consumer to challenge unforeseen feesAnd then...?Their mission and cause are worthy so we will check for their improvements in the near future, especially if we are in the market for a credit union again.",1
60,"I've been a member for over 5 years  I have both business accounts and personal checkings and savings. It's is nice that they give you ATM fees back but any other credit union does that too.Unfortunately, they don't support Mint.com and I've had multiple issues with their routing numbers when I'm setting up automatic payments with my credit cards. Also, they recently contacted me to offer a small loan which I though it was nice and could be useful at the time so I went ahead and applied only to be denied minutes later with bogus explanations and without taking any responsibility on their prior statements.The app they have is utterly useless, I haven't been able to deposit checks through the app in over 2 years! I've contacted them several times and still no fix.I have overdraft protection and yet recently they hit me with fees on a charge when I clearly had enough funds on my savings... they refunded me partially for those fees but they should've refunded me 100% since it was an issue with their notifications system and the overdraft protection failed.Do yourself a favor and look into another credit union.",1
61,I was THE biggest fan of my credit union. Until they updated their system and changed how the bill pay was set up. A combination of bad communication about changes to the fundamental structure and ridiculously misleading UX have left me frustrated and looking for other CU options. I'm incredibly disappointed.,1
62,"I have always been a big fan of SF Fire CU, but their transition to a new online banking system has been a fiasco. Somehow their system sent a transfer of mine to another member's account, instead of to the account I intended it to go to, and then it took hours, literally HOURS, of waiting on hold both by phone and online chat to even reach a representative. I asked for a callback twice and never received one. I was ultimately able to resolve the issue after 3 hours on chat with an outsourced rep. SF Fire CU also been terrible at managing and communicating during this transition. A little communication goes a long way. I feel for their customer service reps, who are bearing the brunt of the leadership's errors.",1
63,"Wow. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED WITH THIS BANK?! I've been a loyal member of this bank for like 8 years or so - and, I loved them!! I would constantly talk about how much I loved this bank to others. Who does that?  But, holy shit in the last couple of weeks they've completely tanked. Their new online banking system and mobile apps do not work, are out-of-control buggy, and I've spent no less than 5 to 6 hours in one day (in addition to other days) dealing with fixing the issues they've created. They've had to hire out a call center because so many customers are calling to complain - call queues range anywhere from over 50 to 100. It's a little cray cray. I've gone from loyal customer to now searching for a new bank and that bums me the hell out. I'll be closing my accounts out over the next few weeks. Super disappointing! What happened, SF Fire???!! I was an avid fan and customer. Now I can't trust you with my money or my patronage. Please FIRE whichever executive had the idea of changing everything. They created a clusterfuck and ruined a good bank.",1
64,Now my pending transaction's stay on even after the transactions are paid and weeks old. So they double dip on your balance as it see's two of the same transactions!,1
65,"Words cannot express how much I love SFFCU, from easy customer support abroad, low interest credit cards, free checking, free ATM fee reimbursement, and a free coin star machine at their branch - zero complaints, they are a joy to bank with!",5
66,"It seems there is a different posting for each branch. So I'll put my review here, for what used to be the main branch, but it's for their bank overall.I've been a member of this CU for about 6 years. When I signed up, it was a pain, but once it was done, they were great- refunds on all ATM service charges from non-CU banks, reps answered the phone right away and were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.Then a few years ago things started to change. They cut down the number of ATM refunds, they reduced services, they reduced phone hours. It would take 30 minutes to reach someone in the phone center in the evening, they'd leave the ""chat"" hanging indefinitely. The website frequently had problems .  The app doesn't work half the time. My long-time password needed to be entered at least 3 times before the system would recognize it.Then, a couple weeks ago, I called the customer support line for help. I was given the WORST attitude by a rep. When I asked for a supervisor, she said none was available. When I asked to speak with a local branch, she said that was not possible. When I asked for her name, she refused to provide it and hung up. I called back, got someone else, explained what had just happened and again asked to speak with someone in a branch. The second rep told me that I didn't need to speak with a branch employee because they couldn't do anything about the conduct of a call center rep. She refused to put me through to someone else. When I asked for her name, she also hung up. I tried the chat, and nobody answered it. I tried calling again, and was left on hold indefinitely. Luckily I figured out how to reach a branch, spoke with someone there, and got a supervisor. THAT person was very nice, helpful, and assisted me with my banking issue. Unfortunately, that took a lot of time and effort that should not be needed to get help from my bank with a banking issue. As of today, they have no customer support on Sundays. None. I can't log into the app or the website- it doesn't work. I ask for a password reset and I get either a message saying I don't have admin privileges to get a new password, OR I get message saying link has been sent, but none arrives.So here I am, needing to pay my rent, as I do every month by transfer, and I cannot do so because their online services are broken AND there is nobody to call because, you know, it's Sunday.I'm done with SFFCU. Honestly, though I can't stand what Wells Fargo and BoA do with my money, at least I know I can get help from them and access my account when needed.  Wells Fargo provides numbers to branches, they answer the phone, and they are pleasant. I've never been hung up on and I have not had issues getting to my money when needed.I wish I did not have to leave my CU, but I put my money there for safekeeping, not to keep it from myself. I will be closing my account in the next month.Would never recommend SFFCU in its current state.  Please, go elsewhere.",1
67,"Oh, my. Don't you want your money to serve the community rather than a big, greedy bank? You don't care? How about getting a credit union that cares about YOU? I couldn't get a HELOC loan and wrote the president of SFFCU. He put me in touch with Bob, the VP, who after what must have been 40 emails, made sure I got my loan. This changed my life. I was ready to lose my house. This is truly a personal business, that cares, that works for you--and that makes a difference in the greater world.",5
68,"Time to downgrade the review.  Over the past 6 years, SFFCU has slowly begun transforming itself into something much less desirable.  Highlights (or lowlights):1. Still no updated online banking. They've promised for nearly 5 years that it was just months away.2. Major changes to their fee structure that make them much more like a big bank than a community credit union. In particular, no more unlimited ATM refunds (now down to only 6 per month), limit of $4 per refund, and most egregious: they are going to CHARGE YOU for using another ATM after the first 6.  That's right out of BOA and Wells Fargo's playbook.  (Not to mention they cut back on their phone support hours).3. New management seems less committed to the institution's values. So, that's it. I'm off to First Republic.  Unlimited ATM refunds worldwide, amazing hands on customer service, and the impression that they actually care about my actually pretty significant account balances.",2
69,Let me start by saying I really do love this Bank I've had others but this one I've had the majority of my life I haven't had any complaints until they change the app the new app is not bad but it's a bit more confusing and I had a lot of trouble signing on I kept picking the option to remember my device and it kept forgetting it and kicking me out.... this wasn't my biggest problem though the biggest problem for me is that the bank would always answer whenever I would call before the online change... now there's 200 people in line in front of me or the machine tells me it's 0 people and they never answer either way every time I waited for more than 20 minutes the phone just hangs up on me automatically.. I know they've been warning us for so long to be ready for this online change but I did not think it would affect the phone lines so severely and it's really hard to trust them with my finances when I can't even make changes online or get ahold of anyone on the phone.... disappointed,2
70,Only 3 locations in SF and limited atm reimbursementsLines at the Mint  (market at 5th St) location every evening and an unarmed guard inside who never watches or does a walk/stand bye at the outside atm with all the cracks heads nearby.Cust Supp 800# is no longer open till 10 pm 7 days-now closed Sundaysno longer offfes unlimited atm reimbursement.7-11 is on their list as an affiliate atm-be aware the one on 18th at noe is deposit only.  Advised them many times and they still say can get cash at that atmSpoke to 3 reps and one supervisor---many excuses...would not credit my acct $27.I advised all the reps and the supervisor I was going to close all my sffcu accts over the lack of service  and the $27.  All were happy to help me close my accounts.$27.00 vs $50K.  Not a smart move.  Something is very wrong with SFFCU now.  Was better before.  Closed all my SFFCU accts and transferred all my funds elsewhere.  Do your research.  This CU has a new CEO and I suspect they are tightening their belts.  All CU offer atm reimbursements.  This one is not special.  You don't have to be a firefighter or have someone in the family who was.  No special perks here anymore.,1
71,"SFFD Fire Credit Union is AWESOME! First, the service - outstanding.Second, the response times at the branch, as well as via the online chat are superior to any bank. Even email correspondence with associates is on point. Third, the staff - Rujni, Adrian, Simon have all gone above and beyond for me with my home loan, cashiers checks, and everything I need. Literally every person that works here is responsive, helpful, and seems to be happy - so obviously management is doing something correctly. I also love the seasonal events and celebrations - pumpkin contest, ornaments and decorations.If you are eligible, do yourself a favor and open an account here or refinance your mortgage - you can thank me later ;)",5
72,"While I am generally happy with SF Fire Credit Union, this is just a shout out to anyone who may be reading who has a credit card with them that their Contesting Charges Dept. is pretty much useless. I contested a charge imposed by Hertz Rent-a-Car (AWFUL company, BTW! Save yourself the headache and never rent a car through them. Truly, the WORST. But I digress...), who charged my credit card without my permission, and sent SF Fire Credit Union all of the necessary paperwork to support it. I received a call today stating that they could not contest the charge because they called Hertz and Hertz said they ""cannot reverse the charge."" They said that I apparently signed my life away on page 5 of the rental agreement that basically gave them permission to do so. What?!?!  And that was the end of it. One lousy phone call.I tried to explain that I submitted all of the supporting documentation that was required to show that I fullfilled what I was supposed to with Hertz, but they basically just said that they couldn't do anything. At one point, I had to ask the woman I was talking to to stop talking over me so I could finish my sentence.I don't know if SF Fire Credit Union is just a small company or what, but had I used my Citibank Visa, this would not have been an issue. I would have already had my money back. I would strongly suggest that when using your credit card for a service like renting a car, hotel room, etc., do not use your SF Fire Credit Union credit card. You will have better protection with a card linked to a larger organization. That is what I will be doing from now on.",3
73,Eight years ago when I moved to SF this was the best bank out there.  But as the years have gone on they have paired down the services for members and the recent nail in the coffin was  they were no longer compatible with mint.com.  I'll keep the account open for cash deposits but will be using an online checking account that has the same services they have and an included interest rate.  Wish I could continue to support a local business but they aren't fitting with my needs anymore.,2
74,"I'm updating my review as in the end I had a really good experience with SF Fire. They offered me a great rate on my re-finance and completed the process smoothly. The rate I got for the ARM (for an investment property, as I no longer live there myself), was better than the rate I was offered for a primary residence by SOFI! I also felt good that SF Fire has my back as a credit union that exists to serve its members as well as possible, not just to turn a profit. When I initially contacted SF Fire, I made an appointment to go into their office. I then filled out the online application. I am knocking one star because following that, I did not hear back for a few weeks though I checked in via email and phone. Then once my loan person engaged on it properly, things were very smooth from there. Thank you SF Fire :)",4
75,"I forgot to top off my checking account for a while. Any normal bank would have fined me hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees and I would be having a total freakout. But SFFire just transferred the necessary funds from my savings to cover it. Any minor inconveniences (branch access and travel issues, basically) from using a small local network vs a giant national is more than made up for by the peace of mind and practical support of banking with someone who has your back. Big banks are designed as profit machines. Credit Unions are (mostly) designed to take care of their members. This makes a HUGE difference in your relationship, especially in the long run.",5
76,"S.F. has so many banks and this is the only bank offered FREE customer parking, FREE fresh coffee with Half and half milk on an iced bucket and FREE fresh bake cookies like they were still warm.                            OMG, I feel so spoiled!Also, if you have a dog, don't walk away without getting a doggie treat. Honestly, I kind of regret I only took 2 cookies that morning.They were additive",5
77,"SF Fire Credit union got me out of a terrible situation, took care of me, and gained a loyal customer.I had a small account here with some petty cash I had set up early this year. I hadn't touched it, and hadn't even finished setup yet. 10 months later, my wallet was stolen two days before my wedding, on the Friday night before a holiday weekend. My usual bank's response ended up leaving me stranded when it came to vendors who didn't accept checks, and I was in a panic. SFFCU transferred the cash I needed to cover my vendor bills, made sure money was available, and took me from a stammering mess to a happy customer in under 30 minutes. I can't thank them enough for their great service.",5
78,"Oleda (spelling? Her name sounds like Oleda) is a service rep at SF Fire Credit Union who was very helpful with me over the phone earlier. I deposited some checks over the weekend and the processing time took longer than normal on account of Monday being a holiday, President's day. Nevertheless, she worked with me to get things cleared up so that I could go on with meeting my financial obligations. Very helpful, professional and friendly. Service here has never failed me.",5
79,Just set up an account here and I'm already impressed with the amazing customer service. Can't wait to build a banking relationship here.,5
80,"The staff at SFFCU are AMAZING!  I am so absentminded I forget my head sometimes. I have been able to get a Home Equity Loan with no issues, I am in the fifth year of the loan, every time I want to change something and can't figure it out online there is someone here to help me. So friendly and helpful. I am now in southern CA now and I am comfortable having my banking done by these folks.  The website is easy to navigate and the APP for Android and Apple are idiot proof, I sometimes like to use the APP rather than on my iMac. I just got an iPhone again so I have been using the Android for the last 5 years, so I have used both apps they are different but are able to do the same things on both devices What other CU or Bank picks up the tab for ATM fees, this alone is worth having an account at San Francisco Fire Credit Union.  Love it here!Dan Berns",5
81,"Now that I've been with SFFCU for 5 years I thought I would write an update.  The customer service has improved immensely.  My main complaint was that the service over the phone was rude but I have no issues for years now.  Plus the online chat option is quick, easy and painless.  Thanks for fixing the issues SFFCU!",5
82,"The service is amazing!!!First off, I've had bank of america all my life, and did not know too much about credit unions. I did my research and out of all the credit unions in the bay area, I have to say SF Fire Credit Union was the best choice. I qualified for this credit union because I went to school at San Francisco State. And If you go to school there, I would recommend to open an account with this credit union.Their interest rates on their credit card is low and their rate of returns are higher than most banks. I like how the minimum amount to start an account is 0 dollars so it was very easy to open one.I also liked that when I call, I get to talk to a real live person right away and they are very nice and helpful.I have a lot of coins, and one of the perks I really like is that they have a coin star machine that does not take out any percentage if you are a member.I am a very satisfied",5
83,I have been banking with SFFCU for about 4 years now and I have gotten nothing but GREAT service! I got a loan from these guys 4 years ago and they gave me an AMAZING rate as promised and made the process very quick and easy. Payments were easy to manage as well. I called the call center yesterday because I lost my debit card and they were able to replace it right away at this branch. My card was ready within 10 mins. I did not have to wait 7-10 business days like in most banks. Super happy with these guys!,5
84,Pleasant staff and nice to avoid a big bank. Their web site is below average though.,3
85,"I really love this credit union!  Everything about them is superb...except for one small thing.  Their website and encrypted messaging system are very antiquated.  I use online banking quite a bit and it would be nice if it didn't feel like I was time traveling back to 1997 to use a geocities website every time I logged on to check on my accounts.  Not to mention ordering checks through their website is almost impossible.  The same check vendor works with a different CU I belong to and their interface is much more modern and ""working"".  I even sent screen shots to the CEO of SF FIre about a half a year ago.  Hopefully they will make improvements.",4
86,"Opened up a new account. Deposited 1500 when I opened the account, then called in to see if I had deposited more money, when the funds would be available. I was told that my new additional deposit of (6700) would be available within 3 business days. What a bunch of bullshitAfter not having my funds released, I called in and was told that my funds would not be released for another 10 days now since I'm a new member. Wow that would be have been great to know during my first phone conversation with them. Fuck this bank. I cant pay tuition now for school ($18,000) that is due on the 25th. What a total waste of my time. If you don't want to let them fuck with your money, DO NOT LET THEM HANDLE YOUR MONEY",1
87,"I got a Home Equity Line of Credit through SF Fire Credit Union recently and it's terrific. I was able to choose to borrow up to 80% LTV for Prime rate. Or 90% for Prime rate + 1%.  Up to $250,000. I don't think you can do that anywhere else.Rujni, who helped me with the application process was patient and explained everything thoroughly. I would recommend them to anybody who is looking for a home loan.",5
88,Called the bank directly and asked if I could get a cashier's check and explained that I'm not actually a member but my credit union is a co-op credit union.  Representative said yes we can do that for a small fee. Drove thirty minutes to the branch and after twenty minutes of waiting I was denied a cashier's check. Manager hid in back office and didn't want to help and instead made her employee speak with us.  I wasted money on the toll and parking.  Very disappointing and unprofessional. Teller was very nice and courteous but offered no other options or assistance.,1
89,"I have been a member for 20+ years and the customer service at this credit union has gone down substantially over the years, to the point now where I intend to take my and my family's accounts elsewhere. The loan department is a joke. Completely untimely and unprofessional. 4 months sitting on a loan application? Who does this. Emails and phone calls unreturned. How do these people maintain their jobs? Zero quality control. In another instance, I requested a check to be mailed to me for college tuition (which has a due date) and they mailed it to the wrong address. Day after day they promised to check on where it went and call me back but never did. I had to call them probably 5 times to fix this. They blew our deadline and I had to scramble to make other arrangements. They've also withdrawn my mortgage payment twice in one month and took weeks to refund it. Do they even check their work? Ridiculous!",1
90,"#1) I talk to real people. Smart people. People to whom I can relate.#2) My valuable time is not wasted by inefficient IVR and impersonal call center processes. When I call, I am immediately routed to someone who can help. And if they can't, they transfer me - quickly - to someone who can. #3) Decisions are made quickly, logically, and contextually.#4) Creative financial services options - far superior to any I've seen with a big bank.#5) They play fair. Rates are reasonable, and I feel like we're in a proper business relationship - they're of course profiting from me, but they're not bleeding me dry.",5
91,"They seem to be the most efficient and warm-feeling shared co-op credit union in SF. I drive out of my way because of the great service here. Their hours are fantastic, opening early and closing later on Saturdays, which is key with my schedule.",5
92,"Friendly and helpful staff, ability to easily get a human on the phone, ability to web chat with someone during irregular hours. Who could want more from their bank?Ahh but there is more! They reimburse all your ATM fees anywhere in the world. Plus there is all sorts of small things that the big banks gouge you on that sffire doesn't do - for example, no foreign transaction fee.Down with the big banks. Up with sf fire cu!",5
93,"San Francisco Fire Credit Union is simply the best credit union out there. You would be lucky to be a member of this credit union. If you live in SF and have not joined yet, you would be doing yourself a disservice. Join right away and never look back. A few of the perks you would receive include the ability to use any ATM anywhere with fees refunded up to 12 times a month, best services ever from a bank, and general fee-less yet great features. In any case, try it and you will see what I mean.HUGE UPDATE: SFFCU just became even more awesome with the mobile deposit. I think this pushes them to be the ABSOLUTELY BEST credit union out there.",5
94,"I joined SF Fire for the sole purpose of getting free ATM transactions. While they have done well with that, including my overseas transactions, they have caused massive headaches elsewhere. First and foremost, their online banking website must have been designed in 1997. It's embarrassingly dated and archaic, and I fear for my online security every time I log in. And why can't I have a freaking user name for logging in, instead of a member number? I need to do a lookup every single time I log in. Seriously, get with the times.About six weeks ago, I had a mysterious check charged to my account that did not belong to me. After the first three calls to customer service, and after a wait of over four weeks, the transaction had not been corrected. Then they brilliantly charged me a SECOND TIME for the same check. After another call to customer service and being put on hold for fifteen minutes. I was told that the person who could authorize the correction was unavailable, but he/she would call me back before closing time that day. Of course, I received no call.SF Fire may be great for some things, but they clearly have a deficient back-end IT system that is a ticking time bomb for a security breach. I'm currently searching for another bank or credit union that will give me similar ATM reimbursements.",2
95,"If there was a way to give 20 stars, i would.SF Fire Credit Union has been amazing from the first day I joined in 2011.  My only regret is that I didn't join sooner!Their customer service is impeccable.  Every person I have ever encountered either via in person, over the phone or via internet has been incredibly knowledgeable, patient and sincere.Their programs are aplenty, they reimburse any ATM fees that other banks charge, their website can do many of the things you used to think could only be done in person, they have several sister-credit unions that you can use all over the states and they are very easy to join.In a nutshell, I love, love, love them and will never ever leave them.The end.",5
96,"They have a private parking lot!  The first few times I came here, I was getting slightly frustrated because of having to find parking...then I saw the lot for credit union members.  Super! Also, I noticed on my last visit that they have a coin star machine...no charges for credit union members.  Excellent!  The tellers are friendly and efficient...and there are freshly baked cookies with coffee and tea as you enter the building.  I heart my credit union!!!",5
97,Fantastic BankThey have given us superior customer service for over 5 years now.We greatly appreciate their friendly and excellent attitudes.Safe location. Rarely any lines. Helpful Staff. Plus it is great to help the firemen and women who keep our city safe!,5
98,"Loved itI email my bank, at 9:11 PST on a Sunday. Within 9 minutes, the president of the bank emails me back and personally answers my question, and then acknowledges my followup within 2 minutes of my reply.  Most impressive is that this is like the 5th or 6th time something like this has happened, and it EVEN happened with this person's predecessor. This isn't even a new thing - it appears to be ""policy""",5
99,"I joined SFFCU after getting fed up over BofA's constant fees and general trickery. I have never regretted it. There are several reasons why but here are a few:I recently took a month long trip to Costa Rica and before I even got back I had been refunded the fees BCR (Costa Rica) had charged me. Also, there are NO fees for using an SFCU card out of the country. WOW!! ( My bf uses Chase and he racked up over $100 in ATM fees alone).I also recently noticed a fraudulent charge on my debit card and I was able to chat online to a customer service representative at 8pm on a Sunday to fix the issue. When calling the customer service center, I never get put on hold, have to work my way through countless phone trees or feel as though I just got jipped out of my money. In person, the tellers are friendly and efficient. I tell everyone I know to join a CU and if they live in SF, to make it the SFFCU. These people know their business and know that great business practices make happy customers. Also, as a member you support the firefighters. It's a no-brainer.",5
100,"Out of all the banks right now, SF Fire credit union is THE best bank around!My husband and I ended up opening a joint checking account here because we needed a local bank to make deposits. We've both been using USAA as our main bank (due to him being in the Air Force previously) but there are no local branches for when you need to deposit something in a rush. The best thing about this bank is that there are no monthly reoccurring fee's and you don't need to deposit a fortune in order to open up an account, a simple ONE time $5 membership fee is ALL you pay. Now, I have TWO of the best banks around!PS: Feel free to bring your dog with you, they have dog treats and candy for the both of you!",5
101,"I still haven't received my debit card, but my account has negative $50 due to overdraft fees?!? I opened the account online and submitted the initial money transfer from another bank to cover the cost of checks etc. Due to a ""glitch"" in the SF Fire Credit Union system, the money was not added to my account. Apparently they had known for at least a week, but didn't bother to notify me of the ""glitch."" What a joke! Three strikes: 1. SF Fire Credit Union knew this was going on, but didn't notify me. 2. The first 2 reps I spoke to didn't know about the ""glitch""?!? 3. In the meantime I received TWO separate $25 charges for this single box of checks bouncing, totalling $50.  After this horribly botched experience just trying to join, I can only imagine how much worse it would be down the line. No thanks, I'm going to use another credit union.",1
102,As a  Patelco CU member I am able to use this credit union for general transactions.  I can say the only problems I've ever experienced were due to Patelco's limitations (ex. unavailability of funds due to Patelco placing a ridiculous hold on a deposit.  Even the standard $100 wouldn't be made available).I will definitely close my Patelco account at the end of the month and will most likely open an account with this institution.Note to Patelco:  Good customer service sells.  Learn about it!  And teach your snotty phone reps about it.,4
103,"Best bank ever!  Don't know why more people don't use them. Best customer service ever, if you have a question about your account and are in the branch, they don't send you over to the phones to call the bank! To get someone that can answer questions about your account Like B of A does. You can use any ATM worldwide at no extra charge, checking accounts are interest bearing, the perks go on and on. If you are a SF resident you are eligible to open an account. You will not be sorry.",5
104,The best decision I have ever made was leaving the big banks to go over to SFFCU. They care about the community and it shows.,5
105,"Not only are credit unions the way to go, but SF Fire Credit Union is the best of its kind I know of. I like that I can access any ATM anywhere and get refunded of surcharges I might get, this is especially helpful when traveling abroad. Not many banks or credit unions do that. They also have better interest rates for savings accounts, better than commercial banks.",5
106,Great credit union. I'm so glad that after 7 years with Bank of America I made the switch.,5
107,"I have been with the SF Fire Credit Union for a few years now and have never felt this good about a bank before! I love this place!Their app is amazing and allows me to deposit checks with my phone. I haven't actually had to set foot in their building in a year and a half! Not that I would mind because I love their offices. Friendly competent staff and a lovely energetic field makes this the best banking experience I have ever had!Thank you, SF Fire Credit Union!",5
108,"I hate every other bank, but I love this bank. They pay ATM fees for you, there is rarely a wait, and when there is, they credit your account. It is a relaxed, non-corporatey environment. Website works fine and not too much javascript to slow it down.If they would offer a business account with payroll services, I would not have to use one of the others for that.",5
109,"I've been with SF Fire Credit Union since 2011 and I love this bank more than more with each passing year. I initially signed up with this bank for its no ATM fee policy, which has proven incredibly convenient during all my travels these past few years. Shortly after signing up for myself, my family also decided to sign on attracted by the numerous other benefits you get as a member, such as the in-house coinstar machine which has made use of our jar of coins.Furthermore, the service I've received when I visit this branch has so far always been friendly and helpful. SFFIRECU makes an effort in providing great customer service and making their customers feel appreciated - last time I was here, they had free cookies and coffee/tea! While the cookies may not be a regular feature of this branch, you can always look forward to the free candy and dog treats. As a previous commenter had mentioned, it's a completely different feel from the big banks - you actually feel valued as a member.",5
110,"I love this credit union. And I cite finding this credit union through Yelp three years ago as my #1 reason why I love Yelp.12 FREE ATM withdrawals / month! Anywhere in the world! No charges from them AND they'll refund any ATM fees! They used to be unlimited, but apparently there were a couple dicks taking advantage, so they had to scale it back to 12/month, but that's never been a problem for me.I don't do a lot of banking - mostly checking/savings stuff, but I've found the staff to be incredibly friendly, patient, and attentive any time I've had an issue. I can't even recall a time in which I was on hold for longer than 2 minutes - and that's saying something for a banking institution.",5
111,"This evening I went to the supermarket and on my way home, my debit card and drivers license fell out of my pocket. I realized they were missing right when I got home and set out on my bike to retrace my steps as soon as I'd put my groceries away. I biked at a snails pace all the way through the Panhandle back to Lucky's, inquired with the store, and then returned home equally slowly having found nothing. I resigned myself to ordering a new drivers license and cancelling my debit card. This all took me about 20 minutes.When I got home to my phone, I found a message from the SF Fire Credit Union saying that someone had found my cards. This was at about 9:30 on a Sunday night, by the way. The credit union rep left me the name and number of the girl who found my cards so I could get in touch with her. They also let me know that they'd cancelled my debit card just in case, and automatically ordered me a new one which should arrive in 3 days. This was all with no action on my part. Anyway, I called up the girl who found my cards and retrieved them from her right away. Thanks to the kindness of a stranger and awesome Sunday night customer service from SFFCU, I had my drivers license and (cancelled) debit card back within an hour.Obviously this success was due in large part to the fact that someone actually found my cards and was nice enough to contact my credit union.Here's another story worth considering:A few months ago I found someone's Bank of America debit card lying in the street near my house. I tried to call Bank of America to tell them that one of their customers had lost her card, but I was never able to get in touch with them. I spent almost an hour trying to navigate my way through their quagmire of a phone system but no matter what combination of buttons I pressed, I was never able to get in touch with a real person or even leave a message. I just chopped up her card and threw it away because her big bank's shitty impersonal system of customer service wouldn't even let me talk to them.Credit unions, you guys. Get with it.",5
112,"If you belong to a credit union, you may be able to do your banking here for free.  Ask your CU or call SF Fire Credit Union to find out.It's awesome being able to come inside a bank and do bank business.  I know no one does this anymore, but it's nice to be able to even though my credit union's main branch is located 2,214 miles away.  And it feels like a real bank!  But instead of nervous security guards and a cavernous vaulted ceiling, there are firefighters and loan officers who aren't annoyingly sitting right next to you while you're waiting in line.  And your kids can play with toy firetrucks.The tellers are all very nice.  They're patient and courteous and not robotic.  Have you noticed how people who work at banks these days are either so casual that they're almost unprofessional or so uptight that you feel like you just handed them a stickup note?  Well, the SF Fire Credit Union tellers are the perfect combo of familiar and efficient.  And why wouldn't they be?  They're not working for a soulless behemoth whose very existence is based on taking people's money, providing poor service, and introducing ever more fees to satiate the CEO's greed; no, they're working for you.  And me.  Even though I don't belong to this particular credit union.Thanks, guys!",4
113,"I'm not sure if SF Fire Credit Union needs yet another review of praise but I had such a great experience with customer service today that I HAD to write a review. Last night, I noticed that my online payment for AT&T was rejected. I clicked the link ""inquire"" next to the rejected payment and filled out the comment box. After I submitted my response I got an auto-response that I would hear back within one business day. To be honest I didn't expect much. I expected lots of back and forth communication and delays. Shift to reality. By mid-morning the next day, I received a response that not only had the bank tracked down the issue but they had updated my payment info so it wouldn't happen again. Yes, the bank actually did something for me to make my life easier in record time. AMAZING. And of course, pretty much no fees for anything, ever. The only downside is that if you're the kind of person who wants to go into your bank branch all of the time (do these people even exist?) the number of branches is limited. Isn't that what online banking and ATMs are for anyway?Key note is that you don't need any affiliation with the Fire Department to be a member.",5
114,"SFFCU are a bunch of crooks. They actually charge ""inactivity"" fees! How are they any better than a bank?Even though the offices of Northeast Community Federal Credit Union are shabby and not in the best parts of San Francisco, this credit union actually helps people, has no shady business practices, and doesn't have gratuitous charges.",1

Extending overdraft-protection where they will essentially lend you money if you overdraw. Cons: There are none. Ha! I sound bad with money. Pretty much the best Credit Union ever, super glad that I switched from Wells Fargo.",5
117,"So far, horrible customer service.When I first called to inquire about a line of credit, I was told by one of the reps that I had to become a member in order to qualify for the credit.  He said it normally costs $5 to open an account but that he would waive it if I went through him.  He made his sales pitch and told me to apply online and that he would take it from there.  After I applied online, he gave the account to someone else who told me that they never waive the fee.  She was nit picky about every small detail.  Her underwriter called me to verify how much I was qualified for and what documents I needed to send the rep.I sent the docs to the rep who obviously didn't communicate with her underwriter who said 2012 taxes were okay since 2013's weren't even due yet.  Hilda (the rep) also had asked me several times for paystubs I didn't have.  I not only gave her the one paystub I had since it was a brand new job, but I also included the job offer which clearly stated my start date.  I had to tell Hilda at least a couple of times that I couldn't give her what I didn't have but would get her the next paystub as soon as I got it.Because my credit limit was not considered large, they didn't send out their notary the way they would for someone taking out a $100k line of credit.  After I made that trip and signed with the escrow agent, who told me that it was okay there was incorrect employment information, Hilda contacts me two days after it was supposed to be funded to ask me to prove that I paid a $33 Target bill!  I had already been approved with all the papers signed and they were holding up my account for $33!  Wow!I didn't have any need to use the funds the first 45 days or so, and, of course, I had nothing but trouble.  I needed to transfer $20,000+ to my outside checking account ASAP to cover a check I wrote during the weekend.  I was told by the telephone rep that it wasn't taking the transfer online because I was limited to $10k per day.  Absolutely no one told me that when I signed on.In a desperate attempt to get someone to waive this so that the check wouldn't come back uncleared, I tried to call Hilda.  She was out all day and her voice mail said to call her boss Jeanny.  I not only called and left Jeanny a voicemail stating the urgency but I also emailed her.  This was all done by 10a in the morning.I made it very clear through my email and voicemail to Jeanny that I needed her help today so that my check would clear.  I heard nothing from her until almost 7:30 p.m via email.  She basically said that she would get back to me tomorrow morning.  That was unbelievable.DO NOT USE THIS CREDIT UNION UNLESS YOU HAVE TO.  ONCE THEY REEL YOU IN, THERE IS NO SERVICE.",1
118,"God I hate banks. Monthly fees for everything. I have to hit ""0"" about twelve times before I can talk to a human being when I call customer support... when they are even available.And don't you HATE when you have to dial the last 4 of your social and when you finally talk to someone they ask for it again? Arrrrghghhgkda&#)(&$#;;!!!!!!1Luckily this place is nothing like that. Easy website. I can cash a check of any amount right to my account.

119,"I've been a member of SF Fire Credit Union since 2013 or so (after laving Bank of America), and I have never looked back. I don't see why more people don't join credit unions like SF Fire. They refund you for ATM usage, they give you great rates on loans, they are actual people that are friendly and actually try to change their paradigm and understand you when you have issues... they are the best.",5
120,"Have you ever seen a bank with better reviews? I joined SF Fire Credit Union when I first moved to the United States and was looking for a no frills bank for digitally-minded and low maintenance customers like me (similar to PC Financial in Canada). A quick search on Yelp for ""trustworthy banks"" brought me here. If you live or work in SF you qualify to become a member here - no need to be a hunky fireman, although you might rub elbows with one when you come in to open your account.I've never had any problems or mishaps in my dealings with SF Fire - on the extremely rare occasion that I've had to speak to someone at the branch, it's been quick and pleasant. I don't think many people can make the same claim about their bank - the people who work here are friendly and knowledgeable, and when you call, you speak to a real person within moments. They aren't kidding about the 'no ATM fees' claim - unlike most of my friends I don't have to walk extra blocks to find ""my"" bank to avoid fees. The next business day any fees are automatically reimbursed - I have tested this at all kinds of gypsy ATMs around the city as well as in Canada, France, UK and Netherlands (where some fees were upwards of $10 per withdrawal) and have always been reimbursed. Deposits (again, it's rare that I need this service) are easily done at any network credit union - Patelco Credit Union is a quick visit in the neighbourhood. My favourite features:- web help when I need random questions answered- the ability to leave notes or add categories to all of my transactions- really, really easy searching of any past transactions- getting paid 1-2 days earlier than all of my coworkersTruly a pleasure.1/29: 29 Day Challenge",5
121,"Friendly, kind, and they genuinely care about your interests and needs - need I say more?? After reading about the events leading and following the Financial Crisis of 2009, I find it hard to trust and support big banks. Following my friend's example I opened an account with SFFC and I can honestly say that it has been one of the best choices I have made in my life. Their Roth IRA has a .25 APY compared to my old bank's .05, they do not charge an annual fee, and I am supporting an honest business. More importantly I feel good and proud to be part of a  community that values people. On the plus side members get to use their CoinStar machines for free and they have free candy!! Every time I need a sugar fix I stop by and deposit the money I would have used to buy sweets into my savings account - awesome. . .",5
122,"I am so glad I switched from Bank of America. I originally wanted to join SFFCU because they reimburse any ATM fees ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, and since I knew I was going to Spain for four months, this seemed like a good idea. They also don't charge a ""conversion fee"" like B of A does (1% charge per dollar switched, or something). All of that was great, but there's so much more. I used to keep track of my spending in an xcel spreadsheet, but the ""Track Spending"" tool on their website helps me do that automatically. Unlike I've read in other reviews, I found their phone and on-line costumer service to be really good and less of a wait than for B of A. I only wish I had an iPhone so I could deposit checks from my phone.",5
123,"Everything that is awesome about them has been covered in other reviews but I will add that they are soon offering mobile phone banking as well, which will make them even more awesome.If you are very rich, I guess the big 4 (Chase, BofA, City Bank, Wells Fargo) are probably treating you like you're royalty so all is well for you. For all the ""normal"" people, if you live in SF, I see absolutely no reason to not switch to SF Fire Credit Union.",5
124,"Dear SF Fire, Thanks for reading my last review. I just want to clarify that none of the issues we had with the disorganization we experienced had to do with our mortgage lender (of our first loan). It was multiple requests from multiple people from SF Fire directly to us, plus a lack of responsiveness in other situations, that made us feel this way. We also don't have an issue with the length of time it took to close - except at the end when some staff said our paperwork was complete and our loan was going to fund midnight on Monday. When it didn't, I called and talked to Perla, who promised me she would call me back but didn't. Then Tuesday, I called Simon who we signed all the loan docs with who confirmed that no more paperwork was needed and our loan should have funded and also promised to call me back but never did. This dropping the ball also happened on more than one occasion with Brenda and once with Jenny who said she would work on our loan in Brenda's absence early on in the process but did not. My take on it is there is a bit of a ""we are here to help you"" on the face of things, but that when it comes to follow-through it's just not there. There are so many people handling the loan, it's no wonder every time you call you get a different story. And maybe people are too busy as well, but as a customer, it was a frustrating experience. Oh - and a little icing on the cake was that we got ANOTHER request as all this was happening for - you guessed it - more paperwork we had already submitted. So, instead of playing the blame game, I think you need to evaluate your internal processes. And please don't contact us about this review. My husband said that even though he kept trying to explain why we were frustrated when you brought up my original review, he wasn't being listened to and just kept having to repeat himself.  And it is my hope, since we now have a loan with you, that will we have a great experience moving forward and I'll be able to update this review to 5 stars. Thank you, Niki Hinton",1
125,"I transferred my credit debt and bank accounts to SF Fire Credit union a little over a year ago. Been able to pay down what I owe by about 70% and have plans to pay the rest of before the end of 2016. I've always had good experiences dealing with their staff. It's so nice to get a person on the end of the line after pressing two buttons instead of going through an endless phone tree. They offered me an APR that was 1/2 of what I currently paid with Wells Fargo. I find their system easy to use and truly enjoy being a member. Even when the occasional issue has arisen they've gone beyond and above to put things right. It's also nice to get fees back on ATM usage, free international transactions on my VISA and not have to worry about traveling with them as my bank. This credit union truly changed my life, gave me some hope and helped me tackle a mountain of worry. I'm so glad I made the switch. Oh, and guess what, this place is a non-profit! So any interest they earn from me goes back to helping other members and keeping fees away. :)",5
126,"Never imagined myself writing a review for a bank, but SFFCU is amazing. I've lived abroad for the past few years and switched to them from awful B of A just before leaving to avoid the latter's terrible overseas ATM and credit card fees. Not only have I saved tons of money, but their online chat help has been a godsend whenever I have an issue (which is rare). Staff is remarkably helpful and their internet banking is easy and efficient. SFFCU is a total gem!",5
127,"I am unbelievably happy with SF Fire Credit Union. Many years ago my local bank was devoured by Wells Fargo and I haplessly banked with them for decades. Then they started gouging me with fees, then more fees, then surcharges with fees, then they threatened to charge me just for having an account. Well that was it, I packed up my saving and left.I have had nothing but wonderful experiences with SF Fire. Their staff are so friendly and warm, their policies are fair, they have no ATM fees, they have remote deposit. I even got a call from their president about a week or so after signing up. I guarantee you the president of Wells Fargo is not going to call you on the phone. He will dispatch his goons to eat your saving one fee at a time. All San Franciscans should switch to SF Fire Credit Union. Support your community, your firemen, and your savings.",5
128,"Im not really sure where all these negative comments come from, this bank has bent over backwards to accommodate me and the staff is always more than courteous.  Not to mention, their banking policies are the most customer friendly i have come across, including three credit unions which feel like BOA and WF when compared to SFFCU.  It is truly one of the things i miss about living in SF and am thankful to be able to use them remotely.  If i could do all of my banking through them, i would.  However, i am geographically limited.  Props to you SFFCU for putting the customer first.",5
129,"I love this credit union. The service, the simple products, the lack of fees, the customer service, the bowl of candy at the check in desk, and their parking garage. As a former long time ""other big bank"" employee, I highly recommend this CU out of all the other CU and big big banks. They refund other atm fees. how great is that? no more trying to find the closest atm. I switched all my accounts (checking, savings, business, IRA) here. Its so nice to call the customer service number and speak with a life person after the first ring. No more dealing with the circular automated system. Their online banking along with mobile banking have been a life saver on numerous occasion. Thanks SF Fire Credit Union. You have maintain the way banking should be.",5
130,"San Francisco Fire Credit Union has to pay the banks for the ATM surcharges you incur, whether it is $3 or $10. Plan in advance. Use in-network credit union ATMs whenever possible.Every time, the credit union has to pay back the bank that you chose to use. I called and confirmed this with the credit union.They have a list of shared branches on their website. See the link on their home page. It's only emergencies that I will even consider using an ATM that is out of their network.I love credit unions and I don't want them to be forking over money to big banks. Also, this may affect the savings rates, money market rates, loan rates, fees, and other things that the credit union offers. If you need some quick, small cash, you can buy something small at Walgreens or Safeway (assuming there's something you want there) and pay for your item with ATM card (press debit button) and select cash back. Usually, you can select an amount from $5 to $40 cash back (depends on the store), as long as you have the funds in your account. There is no fee for this.On a side note, I love the mobile deposit that the credit union offers. I can literally deposit a check within seconds of receiving it and not even have to step foot in the credit union. It has been a huge time saver. Thank you, SF Fire Credit Union!",5
131,"Nice folks to do business with.The only membership criteria is living, working, or going to school in San Francisco.I've been with SFFCU for, eight or ten years now.  I have not had a bad experience with them at all.  Not one.Now that, when talking about banks, is saying something.  Many years ago I got so sick and tired of commercial banks.  B of a, AP Gianinni is rolling in his grave seeing what that has become, Wells Fargo, Wamu, I did business with all of them.  B of A was and is still the prince of darkness, but they all suck in varying degrees.The predatory business practices, never ending gotcha' fees, total lack of transparency or customer service, the 'press four if you're willing to buy something just to talk to a human being' Dilbertesque phone system, trying to communicate complicated financial issues with people that don't speak enough English to find a restroom, we've all been there.Credit Unions, in my experience, totally the opposite.SFFCU:No nickel and dime gotcha' feesrefund all ATM feesFriendly, English speaking staffPhone numbers that are answered by human beings that speak English.If they tell you they'll make something happen, you can set your watch by it.One day after procrastinating about this of literally over a year, I transported an enormous, heavy(!) jar of change over there because they have a change counting machine.  I arrived one, perhaps two minutes after they'd locked the front door.   They let me in!!  This one, seemingly simple act of kindness cemented my loyalty to these wonderful folksNow if they'd just learn not to have three staff members standing around chatting, looking like their doing nothing in plain view of the ten customers waiting in line twenty minutes for the two open teller windows, I'd happily give them that fifth star.But the long wait times is a very recent development which may be a function of all the new members joining due to the occupy movement's 'dump your bank' campaign.  I'm glad to see that personally.  If that means I have to wait a little longer for a couple of months while SFFCU staffs up, I'm OK with that.  So long as they bring in people who are equally pleasant do interact with.",4
132,"Nothing but gold.No ATM fees? Check.I mean really, ZERO ATM fees anywhere WORLDWIDE? Check.Friendly customer service? Yup.Ability to open an account online? Sure, why not.Deposits pre-credited to your account before they arrive? Yep, such trusting people.Postage-paid pdfs to print on your envelopes when you want to make a deposit? Yep, that too.I'm beginning to wonder what you don't have, SFFCU. I'll get to the bottom of this someday...In the meantime, I'll just sit back and reminisce about how happy I am to no longer be funding the evil monstrosity that is BoA.",5
133,"Dear SF Fire Credit Union,Make me the happiest patron ever, will you marry me?Long story short, every review you see here is true. ILLEST banking establishment EVER.1 star off however, for a pretty weak mobile check deposit system. It definitely took several tries to get it to recognize my check.",4
134,"HEY!  Why aren't you banking here yet?It's really true, you can use any ATM with the fire man, and it costs you nothing (although once I used it at one of those dusty boxes in the back of a bodega with the fraying rj25 cable that the rats had gnawed through, and they missed it.  When I called it to their attention, they promptly issued the credit, though).If your bank has trained you to shy away from foreign ATMs, it can feel weird at first, but once you're used to it, it's amazing.  ANY ATM!  Imagine it.  So convenient.Yes, they have an internet site too, and you can do all the normal things with it that you can do with your current bank site.If you qualify (I think live or work in SF), there is absolutely no reason on earth you shouldn't be a member.",5
135,"After a certain large bank which shall remain nameless (but whose name rhymes with Hell's Cargo) slashed my credit limit -- even though I scrupulously pay all my bills on time, every month -- and trashed my credit score, I signed up with SF Fire in a fit of pique. They promptly issued me an equivalent amount of credit at half the interest rate, which I'm using to pay off that Hell's Cargo card and get them out of my life forever.Thank you SF Fire CU!",5
136,"SFFCU I love you so much:1) Friendly live human staff to answer your questions2) Refunds on ATM fees 3) Easy peasy check deposit by mail 4) All-around awesome community bank5) For real the chocolate chip cookies at the branch are worth eatingI actually found this credit union through yelp (thanks, yelp!) and have since recommended it to many happy friends. To qualify you have to live, work, worship or go to school in SF and once you qualify, you can keep the account for life.",5
137,"Yesterday I applied for membership, opened my accounts, and got approved for membership all online, all within a half hour.  They mailed me my debit card and a box of checks on the spot.There's no excuse to pay fees and 30% interest rates to the big banks anymore.I've never felt rainbows and unicorns about a bank... until right now.",5
138,"Do believe the other reviews - these guys are simply the best. I've set up two accounts here and the process has been easy and the customer service is really excellent.Such a refreshing change from the corporate banking world. I didn't realize organizations like this existed in the modern age and I am very happy they do.Special thanks to Max at the California street branch, but all the agents I've dealt with have been polite, helpful and informative. Brilliant!",5
139,"Bye-bye to the days of banking at an impersonal corporate behemoth with poor customer service, immoral mortgage loan scandals, security hacks,  etc. (ahem, BofA).SF Fire wins because it's local, nonprofit and designed to serve the San Francisco community. The customer service is unlike that of any other bank I've dealt with on either coast. Within seconds, Viki set me up with an account and I received my welcome letter, ATM card and free box of checks within just a few days... I get free ATM withdrawals worldwide too! Thanks to Viki and the whole SF Fire gang!",5
140,"The last few years have shown us very clearly that the banks don't give a damn about us. So, why put your money in a bank when they're obviously out to make huge profits at everyone else's expense? The argument that you can't get the same services at a credit union that you can at a bank is flawed and SFFCU proves that without a doubt. Not only can you get all the same services, but the services are much BETTER.First, everyone's favorite feature of the SFFCU is that they refund all ATM fees that other banks charge when you use their machines. This is amazing! I've been spending a lot of time in Thailand, where it costs $5 a pop to withdraw money, no matter how much you withdraw. Having this fee refunded by SFFCU made a huge difference to me ($5 goes a long way in Thailand...). When I'm in SF, I still try to use ATMs that don't charge because I don't want to have SFFCU pay bank fees needlessly on my behalf, especially to greedy banks. But when I'm not near one, I really appreciate that I can get money wherever without having to pay any fees.Other great features of banking with SFFCU include online deposit of checks (just stick them in the mail after you've deposited them online), and live chat with an agent. I used that service today and I had to wait all of 30 seconds for the agent to be free. My question got cleared up right away, super easy, super fast.I was going to give SFFCU four stars instead of five because I'm still waiting for that hot fire fighter to come knock at my door. Jeez, you guys manage to do everything else in a timely fashion, so what's the delay??",5
141,"With a solid 5 star rating from pretty much everyone, I'll just add some more fuel to the fire.. Credit Union. HA!I have a pretty decent credit score. I check it regularly, and I've never been late to pay anything, ever. Let's say it's somewhere in the 700s.That being said, here is a comparison of the rates that are offered me between SFFCU and Wells Fargo:Credit card APRWF: 12.5%, 25.5% on cash withdrawalsSFFCU: 7.25%, same for cash withdrawalsSavings account:WF: .005%SFFCU: .25%Withdrawing cash from a different bank's ATM:WF: Whatever the ATM fee is (usually $2 or more) PLUS a $4 bank fee from WF on top of that.. one time I had to withdraw 4 times from different ATMs because of limits, Wells Fargo ended up charging me about $24 total... f*%$SFFCU: Reimburses you whatever the ATM charged you, and never ever charges you fees for any reason.Some other awesome things about SFFCU.One time I deposited a rather large check. My boyfriend was with me. They took it, made some of it available right away, and showed me when the rest would be available, then said have a nice day. My boyfriend was shocked and impressed. He said that whenever he deposits large checks at Wells Fargo, a supervisor/sales person is rushed over to try and sell him some kind of CD or investment of some kind, which pisses him off to no end. I wouldn't know because honestly I don't trust Wells Fargo with my large checks...Don't want to have to go to the branch to deposit? No problem. Type in the amount of the check online, hit Enter, then mail your check to them. The ENTIRE AMOUNT of your check is made available immediately after you press ""Enter"".The guy who is whining about the FDIC is an idiot, to put it simply. How naive of him to think the government insurance is the end-all be-all of stability. What I wouldn't give for a sample of his childlike innocence and trust in all things government! SFFCU actually went with an insurance that covers a larger amount of money than the FDIC, and I really don't doubt that they made a smart choice.Anyways, I could go on and on about the several situations that being a member of this credit union has benefited be, but I digress. Just become a member. If your credit isn't good enough, well, fix it! The ability to join this credit union is reason enough alone to work on your credit.",5
142,"So far it has lived up to the reviews.  A nice alternative to being nickle and dimed elsewhere.  I just tried my first ATM withdrawal, and the $3 Citibank fee was refunded.  Even no fees on international transactions when using Visa/debit card.An actual reply from the bank: ""As a member owned financial cooperative, we do not have stockholders looking for profits on their shares but instead only have our members to return our profits to in the form of great service, lower fees and better rates.""",5
143,"Best bank in San Francisco. Easy and free phone app depositing so it doesn't matter how close you live to a branch. They reimburse up to 13 (I believe) ATM fees per month, which is plenty, never again do I have to search for my banks ATM to avoid fees. The debit card has a VISA stamp on it so don't worry about leaving the country and getting financially stranded. Not to mention you are helping the local economy.After a bad breakup with Wells Fargo, I cannot express my satisfaction with SFFCU. My faith has been restored in banking.",5
144,"Update:  I'm updating this less than 24-hrs later.  Within minutes of my initial call to customer care, a supervisor returned my call providing apparently better information than the initial woman had.  They are updating their account log-ins, and are in the midst of a substantial upgrade.  Then, today, I received a call from one of the lead IT developers.  He called to figure out exactly what functionality we were looking for, and to confirm that their planned upgrade did actually include it.  I'm back to a 4-5 star reviewer...  Original post: My husband and I just switched our joint banking accounts over to SF FCU.  Friendly, good facility, relatively quick response on both chat and the call center.  Now, we find out that the computer system is unable to provide distinct log-ins to the joint account.  Thus, rather than a ""joint"" account, it was set up with only my information for log-in and a single password.  After multiple conversations both via the Call Center and in-branch, the credit union apparently has no plans to allow separate log-ins for a joint account.  What we thought was an error is actually the norm.  I have never heard of a bank which does not accommodate joint accounts, and multiple person access.  Thus we are regretfully closing our accounts and moving over to another credit union.",4
145,"Why haven't you moved your money here yet? This bank is amazing and really truly cares about it's members and customer service. I was with BOA for 10 years and they provided me with Jack & Sh*t. What attracted me to this back was the Free everywhere ATM usage.  After I joined i found other great perks like the FREE rewards credit cards, customizable cards, the Coinstar machine and now the smartphone AP that lets you deposit checks via photos! I am deducting 1 star because they do not have Business Credit Cards. I hope they have that in the future, but other than that they are really quite an amazing bank.",4
146,"Recently merged finances with my new husband and after much research decided to move all our short-term banking to SFFCU.  We both travel internationally for work and the biggest selling point for us was being able to use atms anywhere in the world with no fees.  The service has been exceptional.  Everyone I've dealt with has been smart, responsive, and kind.  What a breath of fresh air!  We both wish we would have switched over to SFFCU years ago.",5
147,"Phenomenal! After surviving the horrendous fees, indifferent service, and numerous security breaches foisted upon me by Bank of America, I finally had the sense to move all of my banking to SF Fire Credit Union. Talk about genuine and exceptional customer service! Every experience with SFFCU has been excellent. From opening my account to needing special services and asking lots of questions due to out of the ordinary events affecting my financial life (cyber-crime, cashiers checks, a trust account), I can't believe everyone isn't running to bank with SFFCU.Consistently, every employee I have encountered has been incredibly nice, positive, and thorough. I have yet to encounter ridiculous fees or the word no when I needed unique assistance. How can you not love a bank where the people are genuinely nice, you can use any ATM in the world for free, no charge for depositing the loose change that has piled up, no fees for most services and always fresh candy for people and dog biscuits for our canine companions?",5
148,"I was a frustrated bank of america user my whole adult life... One day I finally called it quits, did my research and based off the great reviews, joined SFFCU. I'm so happy! Before, when I used to think about money, and banks, I had this sinking horrible feeling. Now, if I have to call SFFCU for something, I don't feel that dread anymore. I'm know I'm going to talk to a kind human being who is going to help me resolve whatever issues or questions I have. plus, as has already been mentioned -- I can mail in my checks from anywhere I happen to be, and I can take out money (no charge) anywhere I happen to be! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you SFFCU for existing!",5
149,"This place is awesome! We recently opened an account and are still in the process of transferring our money and getting our direct deposit set up. In that process, our student loans were billed to our SFFCU account before there were sufficient funds. Accordingly we got charged two $25 fees. I called just to inquire whether the loans were paid once our late transfer went through, and not only did the nice man on the phone answer my question, but he said he would see if the fees could be refunded (even though it was totally our fault for not transferring the money soon enough!). Today I saw that the $50 was refunded and I am so, so happy that we decided to kick BofA and Chase to the curb!We chose to switch for ethical reasons rather than any sort of fees we were incurring from our previous banks, but with being able to use any atm in the world free of charge, the amazing customer service, and hopefully an upcoming app that will allow you to deposit checks from your phone, this credit union has really turned out to be even more convenient and easy to work with than a big bank.",5
150,"I'm having trouble figuring out why there are any other banks left in San Francisco. These guys are amazing. They're friendly, they're uncomplicated, and they don't charge a ton of fees. Actually, I'm not even sure they charge any fees.You know how whenever you buy something with a debit card, it takes three days for your bank to post the transaction? You know how you run out of money and the bank posts a bunch of transactions you forgot about and when you looked at your balance you had plenty of money and now you're like a hundred bucks in the red because they charged you $40 overdraft fees for the three dollar hot chocolate and the automatic transfer you don't remember signing up for because nobody at the bank told you that one of the forms you were signing was an authorization to do that? Well guess what! SF Fire doesn't pull any of that bullcrappy.I was able to get a MUCH better interest rate for my existing credit card balance, and I sleep better at night knowing that the interest now goes to SF Fire, a small, community credit union, rather than to some huge, bloated, faceless, vein-lined, heaving, pulsating behemoth-blob of a bank that, despite swallowing up as many community banks as possible, and charging their customers obscene amounts of interest and extraneous fees, still needs billions of dollars from taxpayers to stay afloat.Any negative reviews you see on Yelp seem to be distrustful of SF Fire's lack of government-backed insurance. Since when does anyone trust the government with anything at all? They're still insured. And for more, even!Big banks suck. They're for-profit institutions. They charge you too much and give you little in return. Sure, their ATMs are everywhere, but most credit unions, including SF Fire, are connected and you can deposit and withdraw anywhere you damn well please. Wherever you live, find a good credit union or local bank, and ditch your big bank. You will not miss it.",5
151,"Update: the web site is working in Firefox now, even though it's slow. Have a few more lines with them, and customer service has been much better.

But for basic banking, very good.",4
152,"My partner and I want to join this credit union, but we're really nervous that they aren't federally insured.  We're looking at Provident CU and Redwood CU instead.  SF Fire Credit Union looks amazing in every other way, but we just don't feel assured that they're as safe as federally insured credit unions.  I really hope they reconsider their decision to go with ASI rather than NCUA.",1
153,"I'm a recent member of SF Fire CU and I love the credit union for the most part! I love that one can deposit checks online and mail the checks. Customer service is as great as everyone on here said it would be!But sometimes I get paid cash and need to deposit the cash into my account.There used to be only one Co-op ATM in the Bernal Heights area where I live, that would take ATM deposits ..they were part of the Co-op network. I could walk there in 8 -10 minutes.Having this ATM nearby was one big reason I opened an account with SF Fire.. many other great reasons as well.. but...I say used to be... because as of Feb 1st, they have discontinued allowing deposits from anyone not a member of their specific branch. That leaves zero ATMs or Shared Branches/Service Centers in this whole area, the South East part of the city. The nearest ATMs are many blocks away not close enough to walk to in a reasonable amount of time. Now I have to take 1 or 2 buses to the closest ATMs remaining, which are not in my district. This errand now takes an hour or more.Anyone else (SF Fire members or other CU members) from the South-East chunk of town ...have the same complaint as I do?I realize this is a problem only for cash deposits.. but I can't be the only one who does cash deposits... can I?They (whomever is in charge of these things) need to add more ATMs and/or Service Centers to Bernal Heights, Bayview- Hunters Point, Portola, Cayuga Terrace, Exelcior and Bayshore areas of San Francisco!  These areas are seriously under served.Please post if you have any ideas, solutions, abilities or super powers :-)",5
154,"Everyone else's review is correct, they are local, the rates are great, the service is awesome etc. As others have mentioned the website is not AS slick as it could be, but hey its usable, so I don't hold it against them.But what I like most about them though is that they are active members of the community. Contributing to Make a wish foundation etc. I moved over recently. My previous bank's (BofA) contribution to the community consisted of taking a giant #2 on everyone. Good to know there are financial institutions that actually serve the community.I was actually generally happy with BofA. I rarely got charged fees by them because I read all their fine print and worked within their limits. But I just got tired of their overwhelming greed. Goodbye BofA. My only advice to prospective customers is to be good to SF FireCU. Remember you're a MEMBER, not a customer. Its your CU. Don't go around bouncing checks etc and then blaming them. You are screwing the rest of us with your irresponsible behavior.SF Fire CU is a rarity in today's world, and I really hope they stay that way.",5
155,"Finally fed up with wells fargo's random fees and constantly out of order ATMs I made the switch to San Francisco Fire Credit Union.  And it is the BEST!Ever get tired of paying $4.95 to use the ATM at Zeitgeist?  I don't!  Because SFFCU pays ALL ATM fees!  Not only do they not charge you, they pay the ATM fee.  I've even heard that they'll pay the $20 atm fee at strip clubs!  They have amazingly reasonable loan rates, and they're really nice people, as demonstrated by their fresh baked chocolate chip cookies during the holidays.Sure, it can be a little bit of a bummer to deposit checks, but so long as you have direct deposit, it really doesn't become that big of an issue.So, yes, screw chase, and wells fargo and bank of america.  Credit unions are like banks that are not for profit.  And all you have to do to be able to join is live, work or worship in San Francisco!  And you too can have checks with fire fighters on them!",5
156,"I really want to complete a strong rating but they have sent bills to wrong addresses about 3x now. I'm worried about the impact on my credit score. What I thought were transition issues - switching over from Wells Fargo - are still going on 4 months later. I appreciate them telling me when they learn of their mistakes, but alerting me doesn't erase the errors.",2
157,"I made the switch from Bank of America, and am very happy I did. SF Fire provides better versions of the same services, but more importantly, the people are super friendly and helpful, and I can trust that they are actually trying to work together with me rather than prey on me and the rest of their customers (like the big banks).",5
158,"Recently moved to San Francisco and opened an account at the Mint Plaza branch of SF Fire CU. The service has been astonishingly amazing, especially the help from Lillian. Thanks guys!",5
159,Love them!Friendly and warm customer service. I love the branch (and the good candy bowl) though there's really hardly a reason to ever visit there since you can do most things online. I even wrote a quick thanks to the president and she wrote me back the next day all excited to hear from a banking customer.They're honest and they don't charge you fees on a whim like most banks seem to. Best of all...you can use your debit card at any ATM in the world and not only will they not charge you a fee they'll reimburse the one the ATM charges you.,5
160,"UPDATE: I am sad to say that SFFCU sort of sucks now. They upgraded their online banking and while it looks prettier, it is overall very awful all around. I think they have outsourced it, and their amazing customer service. Once upon a time a customer support person was a simple phone call or even web chat away. Now, it is menu after menu of which option and then you wait.Oh, and their so called great new online banking - IT SUCKS. While their old one was challenging, at least you could do basic things like add a bill payee.Take my advice - look to see if there is anything better. I will be. It is truly a sad day.--------------------------First things first - if you are concerned about this financial institution.  You should investigate the new rating to score the health of the financial institutions.  It is called a CAMEL score.  SFFCU has a score of 3 out of 4.  While not perfect, a score of 3 presents a very very healthy bank - very few institutions have a rating of 4.Second thing is that they are not insured by NCUA which is the FDIC for credit unions, but rather are part of American Share Insurance (ASI).  While this is not federally guaranteed, interestingly enough, if you do some research, this program is actually considered to be much more secure than NCUA because of the exposure of so many credit unions which have CAMEL scores of 1 or 2 in NCUA.  In other words, there is less likely to be a failure in the banks in ASI than NCUA and thus depleting the backing money pool.So now on to my review!Short answer: SF Fire Credit Union ROCKS!Long answer: After a lifetime of horrible experiences with Banks like BofA and Wells Fargo constantly raping you over fees and giving the worst customer service ever, I finally came to my senses and switched to SFFCU last year and it was one of the best things I could have done.When I first decided to make the switch, I was a little apprehensive because I had bought into the big bank marketing campaign that you need a branch on every corner.  This is total brain washing!  SFFCU has a very comprehensive and pleasant to use online banking including a very robust bill payment.  My biggest concern was the issue that there was only two branches and how would I make deposits.  Well, first off, like most of you, 99% of my money comes from paychecks that are direct deposited into my account.  So what about that occasional check I might need to deposit?  Well, SFFCU is part of a credit union cooperative where each CU shares each others ATM's which include being able to deposit.  So in reality, there are many ATM's scattered around San Francisco that are usable.   In reality, I am too lazy to even go to the one that is only a few blocks away - with SFFCU you can simply mail your check to be deposited.  Simply go online, say you are depositing the check, print out the page or write the transaction number on the check and mail it in.  Three days later it is there physically, but while it is in the mail, they credit your account the money.I have had to go the branch only once, and that was to deposit an high face value check.  For stuff under or around $100, mailing is great.   The people in the branch are amazing!For me, the best part of SFFCU is not that you get to talk to a really nice human being on the phone, but rather that you can chat with a really nice human being over secured web chat.   Recently, I was sitting on a plane about ready to take off to France and realized I had forgotten to let them know I was going to be in another country.  Even though the phones were suppose to be off, I quickly and covertly texted the agent and set everything up, all in 10 minutes while they were still closing the plane up.  AMAZING!!!!What more to say?  A ton - I could write several more pages.  No fees ever on anything and an incredible 7.9% rate on their credit card.Run to this credit union - do not walk.  Setting up an account is simple and takes about 15 minutes online.   If you need help, call or chat and in a minute or two someone will be answering your question or walking you through.They really are this good!",2
161,"Ive been with SFFire CU for a couple of years.  this CU definitely has 5 star services.... I also love their SFfire Platinum Visa that has no annual fee, no cash advance transfer fees, same purchase and cash advance interest rates, and no foreign currency conversion charges.... They also helped me rebuild my credit by letting me sign up for the same secured visa card... and when my credit score was good enough for an unsecured line of credit they gave me a credit increase and released my secured collateral..... and all this was done with the competent staff without me stepping in the branch.... you can also monitor your credit grade quarterly with their free monitoring service....  im glad i dumped BOFA for SFFIRECU!!!",5
162,"I was glad to switch to a credit union from Citibank, and for over a year I've been satisfied with SFFCU.  But now I have a problem with my account and am sorry to report that SFFCU customer service is among the worst I've ever experienced.   Routine banking?  Good.  Help?  Nonexistent!Update:  the people from SFFCU saw this review and got right on it.  They say that my problem's been resolved.  I hope so.  But I'm sorry that I had to go to the lengths of posting a negative review on Yelp to get some help from them.  Anyway, trusting that their word is good, I'm going to upgrade my rating from one star to three.",3
163,"Due to a series of circumstances too ridiculous to recount here, I needed to open a new bank account and quickly. After trying one of the ""private banks"" nearby, I thought I'd try the SFFCU. I've been with a credit union for the past 20 years and always felt good about that choice. As great as that bank was, this one appears to be even better. I explained my predicament to them, and they didn't bat an eye. Quick, friendly, professional staff. (They wear jeans to work and everyone has SFFD gear on.) Great rates on all services. Flexibility and promptness. A lobby filled with toy firetrucks to entertain the kids. Cool firetruck art on the wall. They allow dogs inside the bank and even have a bowl of dog treats out front to welcome them. You have to live in SF or work in SF to qualify. If you do, and want to start putting your money where you feel it does some good, I can't recommend this bank strongly enough.",5
164,"I am actually a pretty satisfied former Wells Fargo member who switched for a couple of reasons. I liked WF for many years -- branches/ATMs everywhere, some parking, great website and many have a Starbucks built in. Really good all along. But with the federal government cracking down on large financial services and their dishonest practices (moving rent checks to the front of the line to be cashed; high debit card exchange fees; etc.); the big banks did not learn anything from Ethics 101. Instead they decided to nickel and dime their customers much like the airlines. Wells Fargo has been more sneaky about things. I found that my ""Advantage Plan"" now required linking to a home mortgage and very high deposit requirements. Additionally they bought Wachovia and eliminated a potential retail competitor in Northern California. So I took a hard look at the local credit unions before making the switch.I was biased towards SF Fire Credit Union. I sold my car a few years ago and the new owners took me to this branch and they did all the paperwork and financing. The new owners really liked SFCU and I remembered that. So like many of the other reviewers I was struck by the many advantages here.PROS:1) No fees at all to use their checking and savings.2) Free checks, free online billpay.3) No cost to use other ATMs. Plus they instantly reimburse you for other banks charges.4) They work with other credit unions ATMs so you can aim for them rather than the big banks.5) They have a Coinstar in the lobby for no charge.6) Once you login, you can get a quarterly credit score grade for free.7) Free parking garage.8) Very good rates for their credit cards and car loans.MIDDLING:1) Technology is so-so, but improving. Website is very basic but works ok. The one ATM here is very old but is supposed to be replaced by the end of 2011. iPhone app is coming and it will allow you to deposit checks through your phone.2) Interest on savings is ok, but lower than other credit unions.CONS:1) My account was ""hacked"" in the first month. So according to SFCU someone set up a billing to me for someone else's Dish Network's account by ""accident"" by an accident of my digits. I found this ""mistake"" and alerted SFCU and was advised to fax in a request for reimbursement. I had to change my account # and get new checks. After a month of no activity I called in and they had done NOTHING. But they offered to fully reimburse me and they did. 2) Once they assign you a 6 digit member # to login to the website you can't change it! You cannot create your own ""normal"" login name. Insane!3) One ATM total and no other ATMs except for their Stonestown branch.4) A $5 fee to join the institution. Not sure what the Firefighters get out of that. What's up with that?I will say it takes a while to switch. You need to re-adjust any online billpay and cease activity in your old account before you decide to switch. But in the end it is worth it and you are ultimately supporting a true local business and lodging a small protest against the giant banks.",4
165,"First off, they not only do not charge you for using ATMs, but they will pay the ATM fee, EVERY TIME!That alone make them tops but in addition they are a credit union which means they are not trying to screw you or profit or please their shareholders like banks because they are not a bank and YOU are the shareholder!The people are nice and the rates are comparative.This is win/win and if you are with Wells or Chase or whatever... no option, join us in the light side, join a credit union.",4
166,"The fact that I am writing this review while I am so exhausted is a testament to how AWESOME the people at this Credit Union are!Every time I call, I get a real, local person to help me with my banking needs, and they are always incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly.Also, I can use any ATM in the city to withdraw cash, and they reimburse me for the fee those @$$hole banks charge me to use them. :-)I LOVE SF Fire Credit Union! Bank of America was an abusive relationship, and now, I've got True Love. :)",5
167,"SF Fire is the antidote to big bank BS, period.No fees, ATM rebates, free checking that's actually free, and exceptional customer service are the real high points for me. When an unauthorized charge threw my account into a tizzy, SF Fire worked with me to reverse ALL overdraft fees and get things back in order without waiting on the phone for 2 hours and talking to 5 different supervisors (I'm looking at you, B of A).My feelings for SF Fire were best summed up when I was (once again) singing their praises to a friend: ""They work how you dream a bank should work."" They even have good candy at their branches!Online deposits, nationwide service centers, and access via dozens of ATMs (ANY ATM if you're just withdrawing money), make it easy to conduct bank business even when you're not in San Francisco.Thanks SF Fire for being the bank of my dreams!",5
168,"first of all, i can not believe that i am writing a review for a bank.  this is the best bank i have ever had an account at .. free atm fees all over the world (they refund the money a non-credit union/bank charges) low international conversion fees and super nice customer service. when you call customer service - even when the bank is closed you actually talk to a helpful human that gladly takes care of any questions or issues you have .. and the california street branch has a change counting machine that is free to account members ..",5
169,"I tell everyone about these guys. So, when Chase took over Wamu (who I tolerated), things got bad. Suddenly, my Money Market dropped from 2.5% to 0.25%. Suddenly I was getting nickel and dimed all over the place. I was pissed off. Then I found these guys. Now I get my 2.5% again AND THEY REIMBURSE ALL ATM FEES. Do you understand? Say I'm in Vegas (yuck) and I take out another $100 at some ATM that charges $5 fee. They reimburse me (instead of charging my Another $2). I hope I've made my point. Oh, also, they use my money to loan to firefighters to buy homes for their families. It's how banks are supposed to work - they pay you to use your money to help others.",5
170,"+  free ATMs anywhere+  low interest credit card+  better social model than banks; profit goes back to members+  friendly staff+  their security caught someone who'd stolen my card and froze the purchase-  they could stand to hire a few programmers to put webforms on their site, but this wasn't enough to subtract a star for the most awesome banking I've ever had.",5
171,"After watching one of the best Frontline episodes I've ever seen: pbs.org/wgbh/pages/front…I decided to join a credit union and leave Chase/Wamu, which had been gouging me at every opportunity since I mindlessly joined their bank over 8 years ago. SF Fire Credit Union is one of the most amazing institutions I've ever had the pleasure of being affiliated with. The customer service, the policies, the innovation, the financial benefits--it's kind of incredible that this option exists and more people don't take advantage of it. Our friends have moved to LA but still bank with SFFCC because they are that great. (And because they make it possible to do virtually everything online or with their app.) I highly recommend them!",5
172,"I'm just going to add my voice to the chorus of supporters by saying this bank is great.  I switched over once Chase (who swallowed up WaMu, who swallowed up Home Savings which was where I started) started to charge monthly fees for a checking account.Aside from the no fee ATM, I think the best thing is getting a real live non-Pakistani (sorry, nothing against people living in Pakistan) customer service agent when you call on the phone.And, forget about the ""hot firemen on the ATM card"" - what about that hotness that is Angela at the front desk?  She's got the perfect blend of sugar and spice / sass and class!  :^) Seriously though - I moved my auto loan here (2.99%) I transferred my credit card balances here (7.25%) - they really can't be beat.  Great people, great service.  it's almost like what I imagine a bank USED to be like... maybe.... back when Don Draper was banking.",5
173,"Word on the street says SF Fire Credit Union is great. My oh my, what they say is true.Best bank/credit union I've EVER had. EVER. So long Wamu/Chase whateva. Shove your ""Balance-Inquiry-Fee-Truly-Free-Checking-Bullshit"" up your ass. I never liked you anyways!Great Perks (It's been said, but I'll say it again):1. Absolutely great customer service...Wait, you mean, you actually are friendly and are going to treat me like a human being?! Excellent.2. Reimbursed ATM fees for outside ATMs. Um, Yes.3. Deposits at almost any Credit Union and can clear checks right away. Booyah.4. Web chat with their customer service agents. Bam.5. Had to replace my debit card. They over-nighted me a new one, their expense. Boom.6. Great motorcycle/scooter loan rates. Hells yes.7. Overdraft protection out of my savings first (Yes, I have savings, hey mom, look at me now!). Nize.8. Fireman. Though I've only seen one once there. Maybe they just don't run errands in their uniforms. But they should! Oooh la la.Need I say more?!",5
174,"Added two stars back for another year of great service. I've had to go into the branch office at Mint Plaza twice now and both times, the service has been impeccable. It's the way banking used to feel in the 90's before the megabanks started their predatory practices.",5
175,"I've had an account at SFFCU for 8 years, during which I don't think I've paid a fee or service charge of any kind.   Excellent customer service -- much of it already discussed by previous reviewers.  Other services I appreciate: online-chat until 10 pm, easy parking, free notary service, CoinStar machine in lobby, annual Shred Day, candy bowl at the front desk.",5
176,"After finally leaving BofA I switched to SF Fire CU because of all the good reviews and recommendations. And now I see why - they are amazing! Their employees are always so friendly and helpful and seem to genuinely care. It is easy to get someone on the phone and they are happy to help. Opening a checking account and getting a credit card was a breeze. Tonight, I needed help with a frozen transaction on my account and was lucky enough speak with some named Margarita who was immensely helpful, just like everyone else I have spoken with there! It is SO nice to actually deal with real people, who seem to enjoy their job, and who treat me like a human being. I would recommend SF Fire CU to anyone looking for a better banking experience.",5
177,"Best credit union I've ever belonged to! I now live in Stockton, CA and the service they provide hasn't changed. Not only are they simple and easy to use, they also don't hide anything from your view. You know what you're getting with this credit union.",5
178,"I switched to SF Fire Credit Union from Chase a few months ago, and they have exceeded all of my expectations: free checking, free bill pay, great rates on loans, and they reimburse all ATM fees.  The staff has always been very nice and helpful.  Thanks SF Fire CU for being so wonderful!Update 4/2013:  SF Fire is still a relatively good credit union.  They no longer reimburse al ATM fees, but they reimburse 12 a month which is manageable for me.  I have found that the customer service is not as good as it used to be.",3
179,"Got a real good feeling about this.  Opened an account the other day.  Looking forward to walking into Chase Bank next week and giving them the big middle finger.  The woman who helped me was very friendly, honest, and helpful- I wish I could remember her name. I opened a free checking account, that is actually free!  They have a courtesy payment program that is not aimed to screw you.  If you bounce a transaction they will pay it and charge $25, but you will only be charged that once per day.  So if you are under and you make a few transactions that day, you won't get screwed with an immense amount of fees, unlike Chase and Bank of America, and all those other asshole banks.She let me start the account with a personal check from a client, and was upfront about how long they will hold a check before it goes through, for someone who is so low on the credit scale as myself.  She even suggested I go to the banks of the other personal checks I had and cash them there if I did not want to wait, duh!  Why didn't I think of that.  Having gone to Wells Fargo and Bank of America to cash those checks next, I saw the stark contrast.  The customers and the people who worked there seemed so unhappy and artificial, in contrast to the down to earth, happy people working at SF fire.  I am sure I made the right decision.",5
180,"SF Fire Credit Union is by far the best! The first thing that makes them a cut above the rest is their staff.  Their customer service is remarkable.  Polite, helpful reps who actually care about you as a customer whether it be in person, on the phone, or via web chat.  No long wait times to talk to a rep either.  Every time i talk to someone from SF Fire CU i am utterly impressed by their level of customer care.  Their ATM and Visa rock too.  Use ATMs anywhere without any fees...really none.  Any fees taken from an ATM is automatically reimbursed. Really low APR credit card with no fees too.  All this and for an organization that is here to benefit its members and its community. If their were six stars they'd have it.They do have some shortcomings however... The member website is, well, a bit buggy at times.  They are also not FDIC insured, rather privately insured.  But even with that, i trust them with my money more then any other bank out there.",5
181,"I received a nice response from the CEO after posting my review. He did have the branch hours posted onto the Home Page.And he said he would see if he could help me obtain a small loan.This place continues to amaze me..this must be one of the most helpful, attentive financial institutions in the Bay Area.",4
182,"On payday for Firefighters, this amazing banking facility puts fresh baked cookies out in the lobby in addition to the coffee always there along with the endless supply of candy and dog treats they offer.  The staff at this 'bank' even talk with you, speak English that can be understood, are super polite and efficient, know what they're doing, have answers to questions and make you feel valued.  When you want or need assistance with a question about mortgages, auto loans, financing, credit cards, help is available almost immediately and any question is answered within 24 hours.  I realize they're small, that they are well trained and that they offer all their services at prices far below regular banks, but how do they do it so perfectly.  I love SF Fire Credit Union, adios Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America.",5
183,"I've been with SFFCU since I was a baby; my grandfather set up an account for me here right after I was born. When I settled down in SF as a grown-up, I remembered the account, and was glad I had an account already, even if I didn't have a job or a place to live.I've gone through a lot of jobs and apartments since then, and SFFCU has continued to be the best financial institution I have ever dealt with, hands down, miles ahead of the competition. Who can say that they've never once been screwed over by their bank? Credit union users, usually. And SF Fire is even better than my other two credit unions (I have one on the East Coast, because the only thing that *might* stop SF Fire from being perfect is The Big Quake.)Really free checking that actually even earns a little interest. Savings that earns more than a little. Great rates. And you can forget about ATM fees. I can use ANY bank machine - even those scary-looking ones in the bodegas  that charge a lot of money - and laugh, because every time B of A or whoever informs me that they'll charge me a service fee for using this ATM, I know that SFFCU will actually *refund* that fee to me! So there!These folks have gone out of their way to help me out on numerous occasions. Once Visa's error nearly caused me to not get the emergency airline ticket I needed - SFFCU offered to send a bike courier to the airport with cash. (I managed it with a cab ride.) Personal, warm, caring service about my money! Who knew that was still possible? Plus they've get *better* deposit insurance than the banks! Not that I will ever need $500,000 worth of insurance on my bank account, but it's nice to know. When I had to close down a deceased family member's account, they were incredibly helpful and so kind about it. From cashier's checks for a picky landlord to laundry quarters, they've been there for me through the financial thick and thin times. Plus, there's always the possibility of fire trucks and hottie firefighters in line with you at the main branch. And they've got good candy. If better finances doesn't sway you, maybe candy and hotties will.They are of course wheelchair-accessible, and totally friendly about it - any time I end up at the ""tall"" counter, the clerks always remember to offer to serve me at one I can actually reach. Since I'm lazy, I do most of my regular business with ATMs, but whenever I need to go to the office, I've had absolutely stellar service.",5
184,"I finally got fed up with all the fees and BS from the big banks and started looking for other options.  I previously used Wells, Citi, Washington Mutual and was extremely dissatisfied with all of them.  I looked around online and found SF Fire Credit Union.  What a HUGE difference!I'm not a firefighter nor am I affiliated with one but they let me join anyway.  My payroll goes automatically into my account so it doesn't bother me that there are few branches in SF.  They partner with Patelco and other credit unions so, if I do need to go into a branch, I can always use one of their sister branches and their ATMs for deposits.  To withdrawal, they let me use any ATM I want at no charge and they even pay me back that bank's ATM fees!  I do online banking and, if/when I have a question, I easily web chat with someone who can help in a second.  When I do call customer service (unlike most large banks), I'm talking with someone local, not off shore.I LOVE that they're a nonprofit, that they're affiliated with the fire department and that they offer extra bonuses like free, updated FICO scores, better rates, lower fees, etc.I rarely go into a branch, but when I do, I almost always run into gorgeous firefighters.  What could be better than that?",5
185,"I am so glad my friend Yelp introduced me to SF Fire Credit Union.  Thank you to everyone who posted a great review on here, because I made the switch based on your feedback.- - - - - When Citibank told me they were going to charge $15 per month for account balances under $1,500, I had to get out of that messy relationship.A bank divorce is always messy and seems to take forever to transfer things like monthly/automatic accounts, but SFFCU was there with open arms to welcome me and make their side of the process as easy as possible.SFFCU helped me set up all of the following - Savings, Checking, Roth IRA, Secured VISA Platinum Credit Card (no annual fee and a ""points"" program), AND a ""Christmas Club"" (remember those, Mom?!?) holiday savings account.  NO MONTHLY FEES FOR ANYTHING.I was surprised they didn't try to give me a free toaster for joining.  Their service is old-school, in the good way!-  Free indoor parking, but also on a few MUNI bus lines (if you don't drive).-  Free fun-size Snickers (if you do eat candy).I  can go on and on, but they are terrific.FIRE YOUR BANK!!",5
186,"I would love to get up on my chair and scream I LOVE MY BANK! SF Fire Credit Union truly exemplifies the meaning of quality customer-centric service. Here are some key reasons why they beat out any bank that I have ever banked with: -Free ATM - Worldwide!!!! (For Domestic Transactions - They Auto-Reimburse You Within A Couple of Days... You Do Nothing) -Web Chat Help (Phone is Available as well) -No Annoying Phone Prompts to Get to Someone When You Need Help.... Just Dial 0 and You Get Somebody Right Away! -Receiving and Transferring Money to External Accounts are FREE! -No Odd Fees! (Unlike Bank of America, etc.)! -Get Your FICO Score Right In Your Online Account (Updated Quarterly) -Overdraft Protection - YOU SET IT UP ONLINE (You Can Even Control Which Account It Pulls Your Overdraft From)! -I Also Like Their Online Authentication System - Not Only Do You Have to Enter Your Password, But You Have to Answer A Personal Trivia Question About Yourself (Questions Rotate) Let's just say - I have been banking with them for 4 years and I really do not have any complaints (I am pretty hard to please when it comes to services).",5

190,"This is my second yelp review EVER, but i find that if a place is truly exceptional good or bad, they must get their merit! This CU is AWESOME! I was getting nickeld and dimed by a certain bank founded in SF in the 1800s. After a fiasco with my auto loan being charged twice and causing a windfall of OD fees which were their fault i decided to come to SF Fire CU and have never looked back!-no fees EVER, i can even walk up to a foreign ATM in paris, withdrawl 100euro and get charged the exact day rate for the exchange, awesome.low APR, i have good credit and they refi-d my car with a super low rate which will actually make it pay off 2 years earlier from paying the same monthly payment. Credit cards to match, low flat APR for all transactions and no balance transfer fees, not that 0% for so many months and 3%balance xfer fee teaser just so you rack up a balance and then they adjust to 18% that you see with other cards.FRESH COOKIES! - enough saidThe only thing i can knock them on, is that they should really get a 2nd ATM at the California St branch. It sometimes has its moments and is out of order. However, being a CU, there are tons more places that will gladly take your deposit so it is really not a big deal to me.",5
191,"This bank has no modern forms of fraud protection and no means of crediting you immediately when very obvious fraud has taken place. I loved this credit union for a few years now, but now I am stuck with a drained bank account for a few days because no alarm bells went off when someone or some people spent over $2000 on a debit card in a 24 hour period. This should have resulted in some kind of alarm as the card is almost never used, ever. I had written a post explaining what happened, but they deleted that post. Suffice to say, they do no analytics that tell them when a dramatic change in spending behavior happens on your account so the onus on noticing is on you. In other words, you'll know your account has been hijacked when you are declined a sale or auto payment. They also do not offer any kind of protection like, ""don't allow online purchases from this account, "" or, ""don't allow purchases from outside of California,"" or don't allow anything other than ATM withdrawals..."" Basically, anyone who hijacks your account can spend all of your money until YOU notice and then you won't get credited that money back for several days. Also, since my debit card has only been used at one single ATM about five times this year and for no other purpose at all... it has not been used online, it has not been used at a store... then this card had to be stolen from the bank, not from any purchase I made. Also, I did use it at Target last year, but I called them as soon as that hit the news and they cancelled that card and issued me a new one.",1
192,One of the best Banks/Credit Unions around.. helpful and polite.. they always try hard for their customers.This particular building is clean and has a small parking garage underneath.. so you dont have to try and park on the street.,5
193,"Deanne N. and Darren H. are THE BEST!! If the CEO of a credit union can return your email in less than 15 minutes, then you are valued as a patron. Both Deanne and Darren have superior customer service and do EVERYTHING they can in order to make sure I am taken care of. I have never, ever walked away from a branch or hung up from a call without feeling cared for and secure. I'm going to be in my 80's still banking with this credit union!",5
194,Great bank!  Customer service is excellent.  An actual person answers the phone when you call.  So much better in every way than the big banks.  And free candy bars and dog biscuits on the way out the door!  Plus they reimburse you for any ATM fees.  I only wish that I'd joined sooner.,5
195,"I've been banking at The San Francisco Fire Credit Union for over 10 years.  I am completely and thoroughly satisfied with everything about this institution.All the staff is great and every call I have ever made to them has always been promptly and courteously answered.  I used to be in another credit union, Mediserv, and they were terrible.I was so happy when I found out I could join this credit union without being a firefighter.I just applied for and got a credit card with them at 7.9% interest, and you know that is really good nowadays as most banks are raising their rates even on customers with excellent credit.Besides all the banking perks, they have a parking lot and always have a bowl of candy and now even dog treats for the poochs.Dump your rip-off bank with their endless fees, join this credit union!",5
196,"Not all Credit Unions are created equal.Just last night a Patelco ATM took my $1200 cash deposit and shut down, spitting out an ""Error - Hardware Failure"" note on receipt paper. Finding this somewhat alarming I knocked on the door and waited for someone to amble over and have me explain the problem through a closed door. A while later the manager made his way over to dismiss me with a curt ""Call your credit union""; refusing to explain the process, attempt to allay my concerns or issue any form of receipt.Despite the smug delivery, I took the manager's advice and called SF Fire Credit Union and quickly was put on the line with a fellow named Daniel. He was extremely helpful and informative and let me know exactly where I stood and what I could expect. He made me feel that I had my money in an institution that cared about me and had my back. Standing on the outside of the Berkeley Patelco, watching their rude and minimally helpful manager strutting, puff chested, behind their locked door, it struck me just how lucky I was to have made the right choice when I left the big banks in favor for a local credit union.San Francisco Fire Credit Union has always given me top notch service, the kind of service I grew used to at Wells Fargo, but without the extra fees and fines that used to migrate into my monthly statement. I love supporting a local institution, but the real reasons that I have come to so appreciate SFFCU are their customer service and their trustworthiness with my money. These are the qualities that you want in a financial institution.I'm still out $1200 and am patiently waiting for that number to settle into my checking account. When it does I'm going to credit the service of SFFCU over that of Patelco. Hosting a rogue ATM may be a forgivable offense, but the poor service I have consistently received from this Patelco branch is not. Not all credit unions are created equal!",5
197,"Best BANK ever. So happy to finally be a member! They are so freaking nice and friendly! They make me feel like family! They look out for you. Free checks, free checking, free atm access to any atms, free overdraft, etc. Anything FREE is just fantastic! Don't you all agree!?",5
198,"So excited to be a new member at SF Fire Credit Union!!! Bye bye big banks, hello awesome fee-less credit union with a fun and quirky staff. This place gets it. They have a very healthy and transparent way of doing business without the hierarchical management structure that makes banks so cold and rigid. The perks are endless! They are dog-friendly, too!",5
199,"After reading the reviews online for SF Fire Credit Union I had very high expectations for the place and looked forward to opening a new account. I went in to the Stonestown branch today and filled out the required paperwork at the front desk; the woman assisting me was short with me, but not rude - no big deal. My mother very recently passed away and instead of putting the money she left me into my Wells Fargo account, I decided I'd rather try out a credit union. Long story short, I made an error filling out my social security code on the paperwork (I was one digit off) and the woman (who's name I don't remember - ""M"" something) told me that I was no longer able to create an account there. Even though I apologized for my mistake, and corrected the one number that was off, she said the only way I could open an account was to show her my social security card. Like any smart person, I don't carry my SS card on me, and on top of that I don't have it at my SF home. To get it, I would have to go back to my parents house and go through my mom's files to get it. After her realizing my mistake, her short attitude quickly turned into a rude and condescending one. At that point, I decided I wouldn't even like to ask if I could just correct my small error and make an account. I wished her a nice day and took my check to the Wells Fargo next door. SF Fire has some nice perks for a checking account, but ANY day of the week I would rather deal with overdraft charges or ATM fees to receive some respect. I definitely will not be coming back to SFFCU, and I'll continue banking at Wells Fargo where their employees seem to have been trained in customer service. Thanks, but no thanks SF Fire. Your front desk employee was off-putting from the moment I sat down.",1
200,"I went in here (based on word of mouth) to open an account (wanting to close my BofA accounts), and this place is AWESOME!  I can't believe I didn't make the switch years ago. The bottom-line ethics and principles of the SF Fire Credit Union build such a solid foundation that it shines from within on all levels.  Valerie helped me set things up, and she is SO great--better than any interaction I ever had with my ""old bank."" (Oh, and the welcoming gentleman whose name I forgot, but I do know his dog's name is Wilma...he's great too.) Anyway, many many thanks!  Too bad for ""other institutions"" that could really learn a thing or two from the SF Fire Credit Union.  --Proud New Member.",5
201,"The finest bank (granted, I have only banked with BofA prior to now) that has served me.  I joined SF Fire after becoming exasperated with the ridiculous fees that BofA charged me whenever possible.  SF Fire is in stark contrast to predatory institutions like BofA.  The SF Fire staff are friendly, professional, and ever available.  Their staff is available via telephone, email, AND real-time messaging.  They have always resolved my banking issues with expediency.  SF Fire does not charge me for using out-of-network ATMs, AND they reimburse me for the fees charged by third-party ATMs!Most importantly, SF Fire is a community credit union.  Therefore, banking here supports your local community.  This is the new paradigm.  Please join!",5
202,"I can't believe I have been taking it up the routing number from Wells Fargo for so long.  I don't often use gratuitous capitalization, but I need to accentuate the love I feel for my credit union.  Here are the highlights of my SFFCU experience in the order I encountered them: FREE PARKING in the garage beneath their SEXY BUILDING!WORLD'S BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE:  the only person I have dealt with so far was GABRIEL, but if he is any indication of the overall quality, they must be the cream of the financial professional crop. FEWEST FEES POSSIBLE: seemingly just enough to cover their costs. Their schedule of fees primarily reads ""FREE,"" and they even offer free notary service, free cashier's and travelers checks, and much more that other banks gouge you on, and they still offer the BEST INTEREST RATES IN TOWN, even INTEREST ON YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT!THEY REFUND ALL ATM FEES from any ATM in the world.  Most banks charge you 2 bucks on top of the initial fee, but SFFCU puts it back in your account.  If I didn't trust Gabriel with my life and the lives of my yet to be born children, I would assume there must be a catch, as it seems too good to be true, but it really is that good.THEY WILL CREDIT YOUR ACCOUNT IMMEDIATELY FOR CHECKS YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SENT THEM YET!  Who does that?  They wouldn't give you so much trust in Mayberry circa 1954, so how can they do this in San Francisco in '07?They will post your FICO SORE FREE ON YOUR QUARTERLY STATEMENT, track it for you on the web site and they offer a section of FICO educational information as well.  Getting your FICO score usually costs around ten bucks, so they are already doing me a $40 service for free, which almost makes up for an average month of fees at WF. I'll stop here, but I really could go on gushing all night about my new C.U.  I love you San Francisco Fire Credit Union.--Update 9.14.07: If you email the CEO, she writes back within 24 hours, and not a form letter either.  I received a thoughtful and well-written response and an offer to help arrange a personal finance speaker for the class I teach, which was followed up on the same day by the Senior VP of Brand Loyalty.  If this turns out to be some sort of cult, I'm in.",5
203,"This has been my bank since birth.  I seriously had no idea this wasn't just how banks were until I got older.  All you poor people who aren't members - ha ha suckers!  I don't know why you would bank anywhere else.  Why, when perfection is so easy to achieve?I love it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  The staff are fantabulous - friendly, helpful, sweet.  The ""new"" location is walking distance from my place.  They reimburse me for ATM fees - do you hear that?!  Reimbursed ATM fees.  Who does that?!Is it wrong to actually consider your credit union and its staff to sort of be part of your family?  Also, firemen are hot.Love.",5
204,"Is it weird to be obsessed with your bank? We tell anyone that will listen to stop the madness with the Big 5 commercial banks and head on over to SFFCU, where a real live human answers the phone when you call! Now you can take a picture of checks and deposit them from your phone - cherry on top! Here's to a mass exodus from the faceless corporate banks.",5
205,"I'm confused.  Do I need to be a firefighter to join this credit union/bank?  No?  Okay cool.Do I get to meet firefighters by being a member of this credit union/bank?No?  Mmmmm, not sure I like that answer.But alas, my business partners and I decided to open our bank account at SF Fire due to their incredible customer service, excellent rates, free ATM usage (they reimburse you for all non-SF Fire ATM fees that you acquire at other banks), ability to not only bank at the limited number of SF Fire locations but at credit unions all over the Bay Area (woot woot) and well, honestly....because we secretly hope that by joining, we'll somehow get to meet some hottie firefighters.I kid.  Sorta.",5
206,"Ditto to everything already said. I am such a strong advocate of SFFCU and try to convert my friends whenever possible. Today I walked into the California branch and it happened to be client appreciation day. Got a free hot dog, bag of chips, and soda. Doesn't seem like much, but i'm positive BofA never did that for me.Also, their online costumer chat line is awesome. Two thumbs up. Thank you SFFCU! You've saved tons of money.",5
207,"I have been happy with these folks from Day 1. Easy, easy, easy to do everything so far. I never looked back to Chase, those fee-mongers, and will be with SFFCU for the longest! I especially like being able to mail in my deposits.",5
208,"Sometimes you overnight a check to a shady guy in LA, and you don't have enough money in your account to cover the check. When that happens, rest assured that SF Fire Credit Union will attach your VISA account as overdraft protection to your checking account via Web Chat at 9:30 PM the day after you sent it.Excellent.",5
209,"I do all of my banking online/ATMs (I've never entered the bank). The SF Fire Credit Union's website has a lot of hiccups and the customer service over the telephone has been shotty, they offer a lot of great services though: no ATM fees, free credit scores, no nickel and diming, etc. It is easy to get someone on the telephone, the first option on their telephone menu system is to talk to an actual person.It's taking a long time to get a response to our home loan application. Also, Sandra in the Home Loans department is unfriendly, snappy and not helpful, try to speak to someone else.",3
210,"I agree with all the positive posts that SF Fire Credit Union is great. Convenient, considering you can deposit checks to other credit unions in the city, and you are reimbursed almost immediately for cash withdrawn. The website is perhaps slightly cumbersome, but it's easy to use. Why wouldn't you change from the megabank?",5
211,"I signed up with the SFFCU recently and have been completely satisfied. They do not charge for simple things like money orders, cashiers checks, etc. I never pay ATM fees. Ever. I travel internationally and STILL don't pay any fees. Their lines of credit have APR's that are one quarter what Citibank offers (at their best rate). That plus online banking and billpay? Cmon! Awesome!There is no reason why everyone shouldn't consider this institution, or at least question their own to make sure they're getting everything they can.",5
212,"I've  had an account with these guys for a couple of years now and I won't reiterate everything everyone already said (because it's all TRUE, including the general ""I really didn't think it was possible to love a bank THIS MUCH"" sentiment) but I do have two important points to make:1. When I go in and ask for $50 in quarters they smile and give them to me with love in their hearts...not like at stupid Wells Fargo where they sigh and roll their eyes and then tell me that they're graciously waiving the 50-cent-per-roll fee. THANK YOU FOR NOT CHARGING ME TO GIVE ME MY OWN DAMN MONEY.2. The candy that everyone is talking about? It's good candy. Like Snickers and Butterfingers and stuff -- not the Brachs hard candy mix. This is KEY because if you think back to the olden days we allllllllllll knew where the butterscotch discs and the starlight mints were being given out on Halloween and eventually learned to avoid that house. I like to think of it as an early lesson in prioritization and time management.Blah blah blah, alls I'm saying is that if you're in the market for quarters and a fun size Butterfinger, this is the place.",5
213,"This is best bank/credit union I've ever had the PLEASURE to bank with.  I used to have a BofA account and switched, for good reason (see my other review),  when I moved to San Francisco.  Ever since I've been getting (or at least trying to get) people to switch to SFCU.  Here are my top ten reasons why anyone should open a checking account here: 1. You don't have to be a firefighter.  You only need an SF address. 2. No minimum balance. 3. No monthly fees, EVER. 4. No ATM fees, EVER.  They even reimburse any fees charged by other ATMs! 5. Free online banking. 6. Free online bill pay. 7. Free online funds transfer to any account at any bank. 8. 0.2% interest on the checking account (infinitely better than nothing). 9. Free overdraft protection without a set line of credit. 10. Friendly staff and a beautiful building. I don't think I need to say anything else.",5
214,"Love it, love it, love it!Not only do I get a very small interest point on my FREE checking and savings accts (no minimum, btw), all ATM fees are rebated! WHOOHOO! It's like they are actually paying me to be with them, as my former bills for this luxury were quite high.They're money market accounts are pretty good, too, although I prefer these guys: yelp.com/biz/ing-direct-… for my long term savings as I receive almost a point more.I will say that I have a HUGE firefighter fetish and like so many other ladies I am disappointed that they are out saving kittens and being of service than walking around the branches. But to console me they put pictures of these fine men on my free checks. Good enough.",5
215,"Everything Trevor says is true. You may not be able to imagine writing a glowing review for your bank, but imagine this: An airline charges your bank card three times for the same international flight, pushing your balance into the negative numbers! You call SFFCU and Tracy picks up right away. She is over in Pac Heights, speaks perfect English, and takes care of the problem in about two minutes. Thanks Tracy! You are out and about, and need cash fast. You go to one of those ATMS with a $2.50 fee and hit the button that says: ""OK, charge me."" 24 hours later, $2.50 has been deposited back into your account by SFFCU. And the ATM card has hot firemen on it.",5
216,"This is the best of the best for banking. Their customer service is awesome, you have all kinds of free services like ATM fee rebates, 1:1 exchange rates for foreign transactions, free ETF from/to anywhere. I'm pretty sure you can't do any better than SF Fire for a credit union, and I can honestly say that if you use a corporate bank over something as good as this, you're probably mentally incompetent or a masochist.",5
217,"I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. This is the loveliest bank ever. And every other Tuesday they have Firefighter Appreciation Day, which involves hot coffee and freshly baked cookies. Yeah, you're telling me.Everyone who works here is so friendly and easy to work with but I have to say that there is one employee here who just goes above and beyond the rest. Michael is always respectful, helpful, and he's really helped me learn a lot about the way credit works. Every visit to this bank is nice, but when Michael is involved it's a real pleasure.I can't recommend this bank to enough people. They're just nothing like a regular bank. I couldn't be happier with them!",5
218,"After more than a dozen years under the yoke of Wells Fargo, I finally pulled the plug on the bastards: the combination of obscenely high fee rates on everything from ATM use to online banking bill pay, to poor customer service, to an egregiously unpleasant corporate privacy policy, and finally the numerous fraud alerts and security failures on their part, well...it finally got to me. I went and pulled all my money out (cash, please, no cashier's check), and walked it down to the SFFCU.What a change!First, these guys are friendly: the tellers are helpful, the staff know what they are doing, and have been trained to assist their customers, rather than simply parrot what the online systems are telling them on screen.Next, the rates: no minimums, no fees, reasonable rates of return, free checking, rebates on any charges from any ATM worldwide. I like this.Third, they are local. Back when Wells was still a local bank, I felt grudgingly as though giving them my money was OK. Those days are long gone. Being able to invest in a local SF financial institution feels much, much better.My one gripe so far, and what costs them that last star: the online banking system is a bit amateurish. It works, and does what it needs, but it is neither designed well functionally nor exceptionally user-friendly. But like I said, it works fine. And that's all I really need. I suspect that if I didn't build transactional systems, I wouldn't notice the flaws anyway.Friendly, financially sound, local, easy to use, convenient...what more do you want from a banking institution? If you live or work in SF, give these guys your dough: it's easy, you'll be happy, and they'll love you for it.",4
219,"BUT WAIT!!! THAT'S NOT ALL!!!Yeah, everything everyone else said is true, all that kick-ass shit that makes SF Fire CU sound like such a freakishly good deal.  I just want to add a couple more extras to sweeten the deal:-- They have a deal with the other credit unions in the city such that if you do need to go to a teller, you can go to one at a different credit union.  So, while SFFCU only has 2 branches, you really have dozens at your disposal.-- Ditto for ATMS.  If you are one of those people like me who lacks direct deposit, or who occasionally makes deposits at ATMs for whatever reason, you'll be happy to know that there is also a wide network of deposit-taking ATMs all over SF that you can use for no fee.-- Hot firemen on your FREE first box of checks!CALL NOW WHILE SUPPLIES LAST!!!",5
220,"I JUST opened an account with the SFFCU last week, and while I haven't had much experience banking with them, I will say that they were the winners at the end of an exhaustive search to replace Washington Mutual (I will not refer to them as 'WaMu' and no, its not cute) as my financial institution. I found out that there are few banks out there that offer both great, affordable banking products AND stellar service. For me, it came down to two, and the personal, local touch of the SFFCU combined with a completely FREE checking account (no hidden fees or minimum balances) finalized my decision. The other big upside---especially for those of us who are out and about and never have enough cash---is that you can use an ATM in the world and not only will they not charge you, they will refund you the fee the ATM charges. Hello? Is that not amazing? You are greeted at the entrance of main branch, not only by a big ass bowl of candy, but what I thought was a receptionist was actually the branch manager. You really get the sense that you are part of the place and they treat you truly as a 'member' and not just a 'customer'. I would heartily recommend anyone who is fed up, as I was, with the big multi-national, corporate banks with their high fees, high turnover and lack of service. Buck up and support the organization that supports the nearly 1700 heroes in the SFFD.In a nutshell...-THE UPSIDE: (Truly) Free Checking, ATM fee refunds, personal service, competitive rates and the notion you are supporting a local, non-profit organization.-THE DOWNSIDE: That there are only two branch locations.",5
221,"Ah, how refreshing! After reading the lovely reviews of this seemingly glorious institution, I sent the CEO an email (yes, you can email the CEO and President Diana from the main page of their website) to verify the things that I had read in the posts of others.  That night at 8pm, she called my cell phone!!?!!  I was shocked and a bit giddy that I was talking to the CEO of a financial institution (and that she was soo nice).  Diana went through each of my concerns that I had emailed her about, which I had simply pulled from Trevor F.'s review. ""1. You don't have to be a firefighter. You only need an SF address.  *TRUE2. No minimum balance. *TRUE3. No monthly fees, EVER.  *TRUE4. No ATM fees, EVER. They even reimburse any fees charged by other ATMs!  *TRUE, and up to any amount, even if it's a $10 charge from a concert ATM5. Free online banking.  *TRUE6. Free online bill pay. *TRUE7. Free online funds transfer to any account at any bank.  *TRUE8. 0.2% interest on the checking account (infinitely better than nothing).  *TRUE9. Free overdraft protection without a set line of credit. *Not entirely true, but if you want the details of this, you'll need to talk to them about it.10. Friendly staff and a beautiful building.""  *ESPECIALLY TRUEOh yeah, and you can also make online deposits and then mail them to the bank, so that you never have to actually go to the bank to deposit checks.  And, they go ahead and credit your account the amount you said online while they wait for the checks to arrive.  Diana was so kind that I asked her what the best time would be on Saturday to set up an account.  She left me a message the next day to let me know that Gabe would help me set up my account on Saturday morning at 9am, and if there was a schedule conflict, to just give her a call back to reschedule. So, for the first Saturday in years, I was excited to get up early and made my way to the beautiful building that they are housed in.  Gabe greeted me right away.  I brought along my boyfriend to set up a checking account, too, and the three of us chatted and took care of business for about an hour.  Gabe was so nice, my boyfriend and I were making plans to visit him at yelp parties!  Diana came down to say hi on her day off, as well, while we were there.  I could tell that the employees all got along really well (Gabe had a large iced coffee concoction delivered to him by a coworker, and Diana dropped by to confirm that they were all going to meet up the next day).  Gabe ordered checks for us right away (the first set is free).  And well, there's more good things to tell (we were there an hour), but I think that I'll leave it here.  I mean, does it get any better?",5
222,"Why didn't I switch to these guys sooner? Such a pleasure to work with real, engaged people. Oh, and there are NO fees for anything, including any ATM on the planet.",5
223,"SF Fire Credit Union is an excellent bank if you care about free checking, competitive rates, friendly & efficient customer service, and things of that sort. And I do.  Their staff has helped me with everything from something idiotic as reordering checks to setting up a monthly transfer system to pay my mortgage. Their main branch on California is beautiful, a showcase of steel and glass and light. I love that branch, but mainly end up going to the Stonestown one. Still, you're guaranteed to see some eye candy in line at either branch :) I took one star off though because of the calendar fiasco. Unfortunately, their calendar does not feature fine firemen of the SFFD. It is a generic one with a fire engine picture in the front. However, it has the shift schedule so you can easily look up  if your SO is really out there protecting the people and property of SF or out there somewhere getting it on with some slutty hose bunny. SF firefighters work nine 24 hour shifts scattered throughout the month and there is a rhyme and reason to it, but I haven't figured it out yet. They used to send the calendar plus a handy pocket  version out to every member, then one year it was only to firefighter members, though you could get it by going to the bank, then this year I got nothing. And they were all gone by the time I got down to a branch. They forced me to install a GPS in hubby's car, so that's why they lost a star.",4
224,"Best Customer Experience.  Period.Having gone through four banks in eight years, I was pretty used to the prototypical bank experience: short hours, fees aplenty, and living with the knowledge you're probably getting ripped off.I was going to just open an account with the place that was closest, but when I saw the reviews on yelp*, I decided otherwise.It was the best personal finance decision I've ever made!First of all, NO ATM FEES.  EVEN WITH OTHER BANKS.  They reimburse you the $1.50-$3.00 that other ATMs charge you.  That should be reason enough.  But wait!  There's more...-Great interest rates, even on checking!-Online check deposits-Free garage parking.  In San Francisco.-Candy jar in the lobby-Cool firefighter emblems on your checks and ATM cardFinally, and perhaps most importantly, you know your money is going to good use, supporting homeownership rather than the predatory lending of Bank of America, et al...",5
225,"Another 5 stars....no surprise here! If you haven't checked out the rates on their site, do so now. Yup....they charge less than most for loans and pay great rates on CDs (we're all building emergency fund CD ladders here....right?)  Here's something that is quite amazing - if you need to take out a Prime Equity Line of Credit, the rate is 3.25%.  Now on the other hand if you take out a 6 month CD, they'll pay you 2.58%.  Compare to a certain commercial bank that has a 4.99% Home Equity line of credit and 6 month CDs that pay a miserly 1.24%.There are only 2 official branches, but in this day in age of online banking, ACH transfers, mail-in checks and ATMs you rarely need to go to a bricks and mortar branch.  Plus you can always go to another credit union and avail yourself of some of the basic shared services.  Actually I deliberately try go to credit union ATMs so that SFFire doesn't have to reimburse me any fees...SFFire is a great deal and I as a member I feel that any dollar we save them, they pass along to us.And let's not forget that when you see those commercial banks with their thousands of branches or hear about those executive jets, remember that someone has to pay for them - either as a consumer or a taxpayer!",5
226,"The best. Highly recommend for their customer service, zero fees on ATM's or foreign transactions...and, yes, the candy.  I can even deposit foreign checks into my account at any branch. Hallelujah.",5
227,"I'll make the shameful pledge- I'm broke. Chexsystems doesn't like me anymore. I chatted online w/ SFFCU and they said that I could have a savings account there- no ATM, no checking- I'm bad bad.  But they will take a chance. I'm elated. That was 10 days ago. Today we again chatted and NO! nothing for you! We didn't mean to tell you yes. I just couldn't bear the abject humiliation - if I had gone there and been told NONO in person. (thanks Schwab) I'm a 50+ white woman with 2 Masters degrees and a job!  Does anybody know where broke people bank? I'm trying the Mission CU tomorrow.",1
228,"My rating for this CU hasn't changed but my attitude towards them definitely has. I really used to love this place. They were always so friendly and their products are hands down the best compared to other financial institutions. My latest issue happened a couple days ago. I must say that it's been almost 5 months and the issue with my debit card (refer to my previous review) has still never been ordered or fixed! I JUST realized that my current debit card is expiring this month... normally my other banks have just automatically sent a new one as to not inconvenience me but that's ok. I logged into my online banking to order a custom image card only to find out it was rejected the next day and of course without notifying me (I had to log into my online banking the next day to find out) which delayed my debit card order. I went on to web chat and asked the agent why my image was rejected... he told me he couldn't see anything but the image failed to upload and to try again. Again I tried and again it got rejected wasting another day of getting a card. I went onto web chat and the lady was a lot nicer and said the image was rejected bc they can't display images of death (I just hand drew a skull and colored in it's head with red marker but ok). I understand there are certain standards that need to be followed so I figured I would just upload the same exact image that's on my old debit card and there shouldn't be a problem right? It's the same image. WRONG. AGAIN my image was rejected and when I logged into web chat I spoke to Margarita who I must say isn't very web chat friendly. She told me she was unable to explain why my image was rejected and to ""just chose another one."" I know this issue is very small but if you offer a service that I'm paying $5 for, I'd like to know WHY I can't chose the same image. There was nothing inappropriate about it, there was no copyright infringements, it wasn't related to death or alcohol or drugs (these are some of the images you can't use).  I work in customer service and I would never give the ""just because"" type attitude that she gave me. I was so frustrated that I settled for just getting a plain card and she was able to overnight it (without any apology or empathy regarding my original request) and should be here tomorrow (the only positive and the only reason I didn't give them 1 star). I will stay with the CU and refer family/friends whenever because my good experiences have definitely outweighed the bad however there's still the pending issue about my custom image card! It shouldn't be that hard, right? :(",2
229,"Seriously....this is the one and only bank as far as I am concerned. I have been with SFFCU since 1996 and I have to say, I have NEVER had a bad experience. In this day and age of greedy banks, SFFCU stands out. Going to the bank is a pleasure. The tellers know your name and always greet you with a smile. NO FEES!!!!! None, nada, zippo. Pay your bills online, no fees. Overdraft protection, free. ATM use, FREE! What bank do you know that not only doesn't charge you ATM fees to use other ATM's , but rebates you the fee charged by the ATM you use? Insane. I love them. I have accounts for my family as well as my business account here. We have financed a car through them, as well as have CD's. They are amazing in every aspect . I have used every bank out there and had awful experiences at all. If you want free, worry free banking, open an account at SFFCU. A big shout out to my tellers at the Stonestown location!!!! You DO NOT have to be a firefighter. Run, go open your account today. The California branch has yummy candy bars at the front desk! Run.....",5
230,"I just opened an account here and am very, very happy to kick BofA to the curb. I walked in to this branch and was promptly greeted by a fella named Michael who helped open my account. Not only did he open my account, but I also talked with him for about hour  and a half (the account took 15 mins open) about City life and chumed it up.   I am giving this credit union a 5, mostly because I have been able to talk to a rep over the phone for the questions I have had within 3 mins and almost all service are free (cashier's checks and many other service banks like BofA charge for)!!!!",5
231,"It just occurred to me that after all of these years I never reviewed the credit union.   They are seriously amazing.  Aside from the super, super friendly staff and all of the perks Monica C. mentioned (which I LOVE) they offer a really amazing service to their clients in the form of identity theft resolution statements.  After years of feeling totally screwed by financial institutions, it is so refreshing to have allies.  This bank literally saved my (financial) life: can you say that about your bank?",5
232,"I love EVERYTHING about my credit union.. this is the best financial institution EVER! Very personable and friendly always willing to go above and beyond to insure your getting the best service possible, Unlimited trips to all atms always free and the fees get returned back to your acct immediately. Free online chat, unlimited amounts of costumer service calls, free web chats and great online services.. When you go in they always have free candy.. not the cheap stuff either lol the good stuff I.e sneakers, milky way, kit kat, ect.. Oh and they sometimes have free freshly baked cookies too. I love the credit union its that simple!!! If your looking for a bank that will go above in beyond your expectations then look no further than the SF Fire credit union...",5
233,"I was planning to open an account here. The people are great, the products and services are fantastic, but the one thing that stopped me in my tracks is that SFFCU's deposits are NOT insured by NCUA[1], the federally-backed deposit insurer which covers 98% of all credit union deposits.Deposits at SFFCU are instead covered by a private insurer, American Share Insurance, which only covers 160 institutions and has zero federal protection[2] if the insurer ever gets into trouble. While I wouldn't expect any problems, that's just not something I ever want to worry about. To be blunt, I feel a little betrayed that SFFCU didn't bother getting the real deal when it comes to the safety of their customers' deposits. Sorry guys, I know you mean the best, and everything else looks fantastic, but a bank account without a federal guarantee is just another risky investment. This isn't good enough.[1] sffirecu.org/about-us/am…[2] bit.ly/yxtSt (yelp mangles ""&"")----------Added on Nov 16:It looks like I'm unable to respond to Darren's comment directly, so I'll respond here:Thanks for your explanation! While the decision to protect depositors beyond federal limits is commendable, that's no reason to throw away the full protection of the federal government. A better choice would have been to maintain the standard NCUA coverage up to their limit, then for example using ASI's own Excess Share Insurance[3] for balances beyond those limits. This way, depositors continue to enjoy the same full government-backed protection within the standard federal limits, then revert to the riskier private insurance only if they exceed those limits.[3] americanshare.com/Public…----------Added on Feb 13, 2010:Saw this article[4] recently, thought it would be worth adding to this post. It mentions a similar private insurance company, named RISDIC, which insured 30 banks and credit unions in Rhode Island, until it failed in 1991 during the S&L crisis, leaving thousands of customers in the cold. This pretty much confirms my concerns about any bank/credit union using private insurance to get out of deposit fees. Even if they're totally solvent, there's little preventing a run that could take them down.[4] depositaccounts.com/blog…",1
234,"I can't add more to the list that hasn't already been mentioned.  All the perks listed in these other posts ARE true.. and yes, this is the chillest bank of all time.  (also insured up to 500,000 PER ACCOUNT [not per member].Never thought I'd love a ""bank""... until now~",5
235,I just wanted to add another '5' score from a very happy member. I've recruited so many people to SF FIre over the years. They never let me down.,5
236,"Pros: EVERYTHING'S FREE! ATM FEE REBATE! CANDY!Cons: Not fireman wandering about. Frankly, the credit union would seem like a much better value if the atm fee rebates and free candy were delivered by hot shirtless firemen.I did see a semi hot retired fireman once there. I do like the silver fox, so he will have to do.",5
237,"Goodbye,Bank of Assholes, yanking on America.Hello, SF Fire Credit Union.Feel the love.",5
238,I joined this credit union back in 2003 and have no regrets!  They have amazing customer service and to top it off they process my company payroll on Thursday one day before it is supposed to be processed and they reimburse me monthly for all ATM fees charged by other banks or rogue ATM's.  Check this place out and you will immediately want to convert from BOA or Wells Fargo!,5
239,"Yes, I DOES sound silly, but I to must admit that this is my most favorite bank in the whole wide world.  Their service is fast and ALWAYS hassle free.   I get phone calls when my spending (ATM) makes a big change.  The flip side of that is that on a couple of occasions my atm card had been flagged because they want me to check in with them about an item that came through my account.   This can be a bit disconcerting when trying to make a purchase using my debit card.  NEVERTHELESS... It a very good thing. I'll never go back to a regular bank (or another credit union for that matter)",5
240,"Give them a billion stars!I haven't bothered to read the other reviews, but I'm seeing some 5 stars so I'm sure people already said all the good stuff.My story is that because of some crap that happened in a different state at a different bank, any large bank corporation like WaMu or BoA or whatever, would not let me open a checking account.  I go to SFFCU, explain the situation to a REAL PERSON (actually on of the branch managers!), and they hook me up.  Because they have a heart and not a set of gears working inside them!  Let's hear it for real people!The lack of branch locations is kind of a bummer.  But I feel like they make up for it pretty well.  Rebate for any ATM use is key.  I don't know if that's sinking in for you.  REBATE for any ATM.  At least for me, I don't know if you all are getting hooked up with that.  And you can deposit checks via mail (if you trust USPS) so you never really have to go into the bank unless something comes up!",5
241,"I've been a member since Mediserve CU was absorbed by SFFCU long ago.  SFFCU has been fantastic to me as long as I've been a member.  I've made 2 different mistakes, and when I called to find out why I was charged fees, my error was explained to me, and the fee was waived.  I can't say you will have that experience, I certainly didn't expect to have fees waived, and I was surprised and grateful.  They have an excellent credit card that offers a reasonable rate, and I've paid after the due date by a day x2, and no charge was assessed.  Only 4 branches, so if you want to see people, you might want to look elsewhere.  They do have exceptional staff available by phone 6am to 10pm PDT, they have answered all questions and concerns I've had.  I've never had a bad experience in the years that I've been a member, and I always encourage others to join and use their services.  Please note that a better review would list all of the other benefits that SFFCU offers, I don't have the time to organize my thoughts and list them all for you.",5

SF Fire Credit Union has pretty much no fees. Not even for those shady little ATMs in bars and restaurants. They will reimbourse you.This is a not-for-profit institution. And it's local. They do all the stuff that other banks do, but it's free. I even earn interest on my checking account!And the people they got running the show are very knowledgable and helpful. (I had to wait a short while for someone to become available to open my account, and each of the tellers used their free moments to check in with me, offer coffee, and investigate the delay)Plus they had chocolate in a bowl by the door. The good stuff.",5

245,"I joined this fantastic institution almost 16 years ago when I joined the Fire Department.I have never had a thought of changing financial institutions. Some may say it's keeping all the eggs on one basket, but my checking stays here with my direct deposit.Staff is always friendly. No ATM fees. Rates are reasonable. Some are great, some are so-so.Still pays to shop around, but you are hard pressed to fine a nicer, cleaner, more efficient and friendly place to keep your money.",5
246,"I've had checking accounts for over 20 years and never before tried to ""convert"" my friends to my bank until now. If I hear somebody lament a bank experience I always mention SFFCU. They top my list for customer service from anywhere, not just financial institutions.I started doing some of my banking there several years ago because they were associated with my credit union. I thought of switching but my old CU was ok and I'd been there a long time. But when it was bought out by Golden 1 credit union I started getting fees up the a$$. So I switched a little over a year ago. I expected SFFCU to be better, but they exceeded my expectations by far. The top three things I love:1. No ATM fees and they reimburse you if you get charged by another bank.2. My direct deposit paycheck is available 24 hours ahead of my paydate because they don't put a hold on the deposits the way other banks/CUs do.3. The customer service; every time I need to contact them I am impressed with their courtesy, professionalism and effectiveness.",5
247,"San Francisco Fire Credit Union is by far one of the best Credit Unions out there... I've emailed the CEO Diana Dykstra, her response time is incredible. I asked her to create an iPhone Web Clip so their logo shows on my iPhone. She immediately got the Technology Department to do it and the next day it was working. Hold times are very low when calling customer support, and all their fees are pretty free as long as you don't overdraw your account. And even then they offer free overdraft protection from your Credit Card... and their rates - top notch! As long as they treat me well, I'll be a member for life. Thank you!",5
248,never thought I could love my bank! SF Fire CU is awesome. I can go to ANY atm anywhere(!) and they reimburse any fees. I can deposit my checks online and then send them via the mail and since I'm in the city they usually get the check within a day or too. Plus once you've done it several times they'll even let you have access to the funds immediately. If I have a question I can use they're online web chat and get my questions answered almost immediately. I can still do online banking - may not be as fancy as some of these other big banks but it makes no difference to me. This bank provides everything I need and in every way they are MORE convenient than any of those big bully banks. And did I mention you can get your own personalized debit card with whatever picture you want (well as long as you own the picture). Can't say enough good things about this place.,5
249,I wish every financial institution used SFFCU as a role model.  The people that help me on the phone are nothing but easy to work with human beings despite the fact that I never know my member number.  They offer the best rates of all my credit unions (and banks of course) so they have almost all my precious pennies.  I am not charged ridiculous fees for letting them use my money.  I love them.,5

251,"After having read the rave reviews here on yelp, the first thing that struck me about this place was the fact that when I called them, the *very first* option on their telephone menu system was to talk to an actual person; this alone was eminently humane, given all the companies out there that bury their ""talk to a person"" option at the end of a long list several levels deep.  I've pressed that button twice now, and have only had to wait a minute or two to talk to a helpful employee.When I visited their main branch, because of all the ecstatic reviews here, I was basically expecting a red carpet to be drawn out for me with bank employees kissing my feet, asking me how I could be helped.  To my (very slight) disappointment, this wasn't the case; there wasn't a super-friendly person sitting next to the candy bowl at the entrance there to greet me, and after a bit of wandering I couldn't see any other employees waiting to help people, I just stood in line for a teller.  I assumed that the teller would redirect me to some more experienced person designated to explaining the options for banking to me, which was my experience at other banks, but this wasn't the case; when I said I wanted to set up a bank account, they politely gave me a form and asked me to fill it out.Apparently Sandra, who was normally in charge of setting up new accounts, was busy at the time, and given that I was visiting them on the end of a Saturday, I was asked if it'd be okay to just have my new checkbook and ATM card mailed to me.  I guess the teller forgot about the $5 fee required to do a credit report on me, though, because Sandra contacted me about that on Monday and I had to visit them again to drop that off.At any rate, I received my ATM card and checkbook in the mail shortly thereafter, and I love the ""no ATM fees ever"" thing.  I was a little worried that I might have to do something annoying like fill out a refund form every time I got charged by a foreign ATM, but this isn't the case; I made my first withdrawal from a Bank of America ATM yesterday, and SFFCU automatically refunded me the $3 fee today.Perhaps it's partly because of all these great Yelp reviews, but despite some of the hiccups, I got the impression that everyone I talked to enjoyed working at this place and genuinely wanted to help me.  So I'm looking forward to continuing to be a customer of theirs, and will be sure to Yelp about any particularly positive or negative experiences I have.",4
252,"I can't say enough good things about SF Fire Credit Union - they are the most amazing financial institution ever.  I've told everyone I know to switch banks.  I've even found myself ranting about how wonderful they are to friends at 2am!Here are some of the perks:- Free everything.  Pay for nothing.  Any ATM, anywhere.- On their website, you can ""email"" the President/CEO.  I did so, asking if they would accept State of California ""IOUs"" ... The President/CEO emailed be back, within an hour, at 8pm on a SUNDAY NIGHT!  - Deposit checks at any other credit union ATM, or deposit checks ONLINE.  They credit you the full amount, and then you have 7 days to get them the check.  No holds on the money.  They will even give you pre-paid, pre-addresses envelopes for this.- Real local people to talk to on the phone and via the website.- Amazing overdraft protection.  I've never bounced anything in my life, but now I could without paying $40.  My SF Fire CU credit card will simply charge (as if it was a retail purchase) anything that 'bounces'.  No fees.I always banked with Wells Fargo in the past.  I kept them mostly because they have ATM everywhere.  SF Fire CU is 500 times better.  Plus, I'm not banking with a evil corporate bank.  This is local, non-profit, and awesome.",5
253,"A great bank to work with. You get the use of any ATM without fees 12 times each month. There are no foreign transaction fees abroad, free quarterly credit reports, and great rates on loans. It's a bank you can actually like!,",5
254,"I'd like to give this place more stars but It just wouldn't sit well with me.  My main complaint is that some of the new staff do not seem to understand rules regarding deposits and basic listening skills.  I recently attempted to deposit a check into my account. The check was addressed to me And my wife.  In order to process the request, they required that my wife be present to confirm the transaction.  This is an inconvenience  encountered in the past, so I had had my wife co-sign the check. They still would not allow it.  I asked Anita, the teller, if she would then deposit the check into my wife's account.  She still would not allow it. WTF?  I've been a member of this branch for 10 years and a CU member for over 30 years and I have never heard of  this requiremlent.  Anita then asked her associate next to her and she too confirmed that my wife would have to be present to complete the transaction.  Her associate then proceeded to lecture me on the issues of fraud. Again, WTF?  At this point  I was livid. They directed me to the branch manager, Aleksey Chursin and apparently told him that I wanted to deposit the check into My account.  I realized the miscommunication, informed him of what I wanted and he deposited the check to wife's account.  Such a simple request should not turn into a time-wasting venture. I think SFFire needs to educate their rookie tellers on basic listening/communication skills and recruit tellers with better problem-solving skills.  Being that Anita had only been working there a few months is no excuse.",4
255,"Free checking, free ATMs everywhere.  When other banks charge for their ATMs, SFFCU credits you for the fee. Awesome. Although I often get mistaken for one, I am not a fire fighter, and all you have to be to join is a resident. Today they had fresh baked cookies and coffee. Wells Fargo I miss you not!",5
256,Five years and still going strong. I ditched Wells and Citibank to switch to SFFCU and never looked back.  Great service. great prices. And sweet treats at the door.  What more can you ask in a bank.  Oh and they go the extra mile when you need to catch that rare check from clearing until you get a deposit in.  What a great team.,5
257,Best Bank I have ever been with. I am currently in Europe right now and had a tiny mishap with my debit card but their customer service through the internet and the phone has been consistently amazing! I've been using my ATM card throughout Europe without a hassle or a fee! Thank you!,5
258,"A lot of issues signing up jointly online. I called to have the issue resolved, but the guy who answered told me that he didn't think it could even be done online... which contradicted what my husband was told in the first place. Furthermore, there is an option to sign up a joint account...online. The guy seemed impatient and a little rude, so I won't be bothering with RE-doing the whole process... as I was told we'd have to do. Ugh. Plus, if there are tech issue with the sign up... why would I trust that there wouldn't be other tech issues?  Sigh. Off to find another banking institution. I'd love a decent one. :)",1
259,"I was a little apprehensive at first but I'm really glad I made the switch.  I've been depositing checks at other CU's such as Redwood and Provident and there haven't been any problems.  I really like free bank transfers to any external branch.  You can even withdraw money from external banks to your account too.  When I was with Chase, there wasn't a single ATM close to my house now I can go use the ATM at Walgreens which is just a few blocks away and don't get charged any fees.  Also, when you go to their branches, the people there are so nice.  It really feels like a community in there.  I wish I was more knowledgeable about CU's years ago; it would have made my life soooo many easier.",5
260,"This is how banking should be.  Transparent, great services, fantastically friendly people.  Insurance by ASI (not FDIC, noted by other reviews) is a concern, but far outweighed by the other benefits.",5

264,I love this credit union. I wish they had more offices in other location in the city. I have had an account with them since 2002. Their rates on loan products are lower that most other credit unions or banks. Another big plus is anyone that resides or works in the city can join.,5
265,"No fees! No monthly fees. No insufficient funds fees. No transfer fees. No overdraft fees. No fees for going over a magical number of ATM transactions. Your checks are free (unless you get special ones) and they reimburse any ATM surcharges you get for using your card in another bank's ATM. They provide free quarterly credit rating assessments and have handy online budget calculators to help you knock out debt or plan for retirement or other big financial events. Doesn't work in Mint yet, but they have enough calculators of their own, you should be fine without that.I was this close to going with another small local bank, the number two one rated on this very site for San Francisco, and decided to go with this one despite its less convenient location because NO FEES! Hear that, banks? We give you our money to play with. You earn interest and dividends and whatnot with it. You don't need to nickel and dime your customers to within an inch of their lives over every little thing.I wonder how much I've spent over the years just in bank fees. I'd go through my old statements and add it up, but I'm sort of afraid of the answer.",5

270,"I LOVE SFFCU! I keep wondering ""what's the catch?"" But there is none. They're just awesome. Great services, great rates. I opened checking, got a visa saving 8% versus my chase card, and refinanced my car at 2.7% lower rate. This is the best kept secret, and I want to spread the word.",5
271,"Reimbursed ATMs, no random fees and perfect customer service.",5
272,"Joined this bank when I became a firefighter, so I'm a little biased.  But this bank totally kicks the other banks in their sorry asses.  There ain't a thing they can't do for me that the big-name banks brag about.  Plus, I LOVE it when you walk into a place where you keep all your money, and they know your face and name.  The no-ATM-fee thingie just clinches all that with a big red bow.  Everybody's like family there, so if I lost my mind and wanted to buy me a Bentley like P. Diddy's, they'd hand me my head.  If I wanted to buy a new home, they'd make that possible.  These people CARE what you do with your money.",5
273,I love this credit union! I have a special hatred for commercial banks and have found credit union to be more customer focused... The tellers here are friendly and helpful.  It is small so they get to know you. Love them!,5
274,"granted, i've only been a member of this credit union for one week, but i'm giving it 5 stars: i went to set up my online account, but was having trouble signing up/logging on. i tried a couple times before i noticed right there on the screen an option to IM with a bank representative. i clicked it. went back and forth with a REAL PERSON for a few minutes (see my washington mutual reviews for reference) until the problem was resolved. voila! LOVE THAT! i'm so excited to belong to a friendly, non-corporate bank that gives me a refund for ANY ATM charges i incur at any bank in the US. yep, that's right. eat your heart out, WAMU. no fees for anything! (my ex used to charge me 12 bucks to transfer money from one account to another as ""overdraft protection."" wtf?)  maybe i'll bounce a check just for the fun of it... (j/k)today i had a free 1/2 hour conversation with nick the financial planner. i'll be faxing him all my mutual fund, IRA and retirement statements so he can analyze my savings and help me come up with a financial plan. FREE! love this credit union! can you say that about your bank?!",5
275,"Let me start by saying that this is the BEST CU in SF, period. The only downside was that their website was a bit outdated, but they recently revamped it and now it's as streamlined and intuitive as any other nationwide banking website. The design is simplistic and well thought out, and everything I could possibly need to do online is taken care of. Beyond that, the service at their branches is second to none. I was shopping at Stonestown one day and decided to kick WAMU to the curb years ago and I'm glad I did. Don't fall for free checking at WAMU or any other bank, because they'll hit your account hard with every fee possible in the end. SF Fire does an incredible job making sure everybody is satisfied. You can even contact their CEO personally if you have any questions on their website and within hours, you'll get a thoughtful, caring reply (Hi Diana!)Most importantly, and I can't stress this enough, but anybody under the age of 25 who is reading this should really consider leaving their nationwide bank for SF Fire. You'll get treated better, you'll have more of your money, and you'll have so many more options as you grow up with them. Think about how much money you lose going to ATMs when you're out with your friends. The ATM refunds you get are but one of the perks of being a member. Don't be another poor schlub looking for a BofA on a Friday night, and moreso, don't put up with the predatory lending at most banks. Go with somebody who looks out for you more than most. Drop your bank and go with SF Fire CU.",5
276,"The best bank ever! So happy that I am now banking with them. I plan to close out my WAMU account so I can just use this bank. Never have to pay a subcharge fee anywhere, can access your check instantly even if it hasn't been deposited to your account, free quarterly fico score, you get live help if you can't go to the bank in person and they give you the best rates possible for loans. Their visa card is awesome! No balance fees nor cash advance or foreign transaction fee. Who can beat that?? Love this bank!",5
277,decided to switch to a credit union and found this one through yelp. so happy with my decision!! in addition to all the awesomeness that is mentioned in many reviews below - my paycheck direct deposit comes in a day early!,5
278,After all the ridiculous fees associated with my current bank I decided to join a credit union. Opening an account here was a great financial move. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. I was approved for a credit card with an apr half of that of my current one! I no longer have to pay ATM fees either. If you are tired of your bank screwing you over and charging you left and right make the move to the SF Fire Credit Union!,5
279,Sooo I can finally write them a review since I no longer work there.  Working at the california branch was amazing.  The CEO and the branch manager are both amazing and helpful.  You don't have to be a fire fighter you just have to work or live in SF.  Pretty much no fees and you can deposit checks via atm(no holds!) and online(still no holds!)  you can deposit at credit unions all over the bay area!!!,5
280,"SFFCU is the best bank in SF.  Seriously.  I used to think that I didn't want to go with a small local bank because it wouldn't be convenient.  If you use your debit card to withdraw cash from say a Wells Fargo or a Bank of America ATM (or any other bank), SFFCU refunds the transaction fee.  How convenient is that?  Their credit card and loan rates are the lowest going.  And if you use your debit card while traveling abroad, they don't charge you a transaction fee to access your own cash; and if you use their credit card, you are not gouged with the ""foreign transaction fee"" that all of the other banksters charge.  SFFCU's employees are knowledgeable, courteous and friendly.  Why in the world would you allow any bank to charge you to access your own cash?  Why would you let a bank charge you to have a checking account with their institution?  Why would you let a bank hold your hard earned money for days before you were ""allowed"" to access it?  Call me old fashioned but I expect a bank to make my life easier, and in these tough financial times, how could you let a bank nickel and dime you?  Vote with your feet and move your money and your business to SFFCU today.  You won't regret it.  Dump the banksters and tell them where to put their transaction fees.  It's your money honey.  Beware the candy bowl and the freshly baked cookies on Tuesdays!!!!!",5
281,Incredibly friendly. No ATM fees anywhere in the world. They give us chocolate. They are *not* BofA.,5
